# CSCE-470-Project

For the algorithm checkpoint, the required files are:

naive_bayes_test.py

doc_class_rw.py

and two directories:

Data2-names/

Data2/

We are using Python 2.7 for this project. 
This selection does not require any special
packages or arguments to run.

This code is currently configured to run in
a Windows environment.


Output: The program will use 100 stories as training data
for the naive classifier, then it will be tested on the next
25 stories. All the stories in this case have a known genre.
This allows to see what our classifier is doing, and were
we might need to reconsider some of our program features.
