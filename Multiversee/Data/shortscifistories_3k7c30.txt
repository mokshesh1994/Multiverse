Lights in the Dark
SJ-Sathanas_80
Thunder in the skies, the *Endurance* and *Atlantia* have crossed blades. Fifty millimeter sabot at eighty rounds per minute, barrels belching flame, heat sinks straining, *Endurance* dumps her coolant gel. Shimmering droplets lazily drifting amidst the carnage. Gathering shrapnel as they swim, free from gravity.

*Atlantia* is hit, tungsten skeleton groaning as she reels onto her side, her decks ablaze. Depleted uranium armor becomes dust,fueling the glowing pyre. *Atlantia* is dead, internal explosions poison her atmosphere, screams echo through the dissipating oxygen, her crew is reunited with the cosmos.

Flashes and bending light, a para drive, *Triarius* has arrived. She draws her weapon, *Endurance* is her rival, movement in the bow of *Triarius*. Solid metal ammunition in place, magnetic fields and hellish temperature, *Triarius* lunges. A pearl-white lance across the void, ferrous material as fast as a ray of starlight, *Endurance* dies, superheated plating and gasses vaporise as her back snaps, *Triarius* has put a dagger through her heart.

Lights in the dark, the void consumes all in the end.

(wanted to write about space combat in a different style, hope the imagery isn't too heavy-handed :p)
