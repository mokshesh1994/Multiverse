[OC] From the Abyss

They came from the cold depths beyond what we could fathom. From out beyond our galaxy, from beyond the reaches of the closest starlight. We never saw their faces- or we think we didn't. Maybe those things that they sent were some part of them. The ships would come, moving as one unit, one shimmering cloud if polished black panels that would come and unleash their brood. The races of this galaxy squabbled before they came, but when they did, we were United behind one goal, one purpose: survival.

The things they sent were always an analog of the things they destroyed. Their sleek, grey form would always vaguely resemble the species that they razed to the ground. In this way they could use the weapons and tools of the fallen, take over their civilization, and then raze it to the ground. No one knows what happens to a planet after it is taken over in this way, but we do know that they come back tenfold. Their technology was far superior to any of the four races in this galaxy, and they could have easily extinguished any of the four the moment they came. But whether it was some tactical lapse in reason, or a cruel joke they played on us, they isolated the weak. Cut off trade routes and let colonies starve, send one ship to conquer a planet holding billions. Whenever victory seemed imminent, another would come, hidden until that moment. Or maybe they would unleash their foul brood onto the earth. Or maybe they would simply bombard the planet from orbit. Somehow, they would always get their way.

Their fleet grew and fragmented into many smaller fleets which fragmented and grew again, but their conquest was slow. Conquering a planet could take hours, their transport was instantaneous, and their growth was rapid, but they liked to sit and wait. For what, we never knew. 

As of now they have conquered the home planet of the Rishaad and destroyed the resource colonies of the starving Natlek. The refugees have mostly become soldiers, throwing their lives at the invaders when they have nothing left to lose. But for a while, everything stopped. Ships would still disappear near controlled space, but the relentless onslaught was halted. 

Now a chill has fallen over the galaxy. A human colony on the fringes if their territory went dark five standard days ago. More soon followed. We now march to war, and most possibly our deaths. May this be the last record of I, Nurmith, leading commander of the Ytesh army and one of four grand warleaders. I know that I will never return from this. But if, when the end comes, it buys my clan a few more days of seeing the sun, then I am willing to lead on. 

Hirgoth save me. Hirgoth save all of us. I shall pray for the humans.

____________________________________

When the warleaders and their selected officers had walked into the treaty room for the first time, everyone was silent. This had been after each race had first engaged the invaders on their own, and each had been defeated. It was fear and loss that had driven them to silence. Now, it was fear and panic that drove them to madness. 30 voices in three languages squabbling over each other, debating, yelling within their party and at others. The spines of Rishaad members rippled, the scales of the Y'tesh bloomed in rippling bright colors, and the back crests of the Natlek were rigid and flushed bright yellow. Only the Humans remained silent, no emotions betraying them.

That was what the other races had found unsettling about humans. They had no crests, no color change, no spines. Only subtle movements of their facial muscles betrayed any thought, and even these they would control and deceive with. The stone faces of the human war party shared nothing beneath their shallow gas masks. Billions of years of evolution on a planet with such a rich atmosphere had pampered human respiratory systems, and they were unable to breath in the thin air of the council chamber.

Order was called and the room was silent. The opening motion was made by the Rishaad, whose meeting with the humans was the first recorded instance of contact. He announced to the chamber, My deepest condolences. If we had anything to give, any planets for recolonization, we would give them, but we have nothing.

There was a pause as the translated versions of the audio were piped into the soundpieces of each civilization.

The Ytesh warleader stood and said, The Ytesh empire is still untouched. We have many planets under our control that our mostly empty. You would be welcome to colonize any of them in the wake of this. Ill give you the coordinates of the systems, and you may begin evacuating your people at once.

Another pause as the translated message was broadcast to each race. When the message was finished, the human warleader finally spoke, Thank you for your most gracious offer. But we will not be needing it.

Whispers began to rise among the different factions as the message ended at different times in each language. The delay from translation frustrated some, but the warleaders kept their subsidiaries calm as the confusion set in. Were the humans suicidal?

The Ytesh spoke again. Do you mean to say that you will accept no aid?

Yes, I do. And we will accept no military aid as well. If you can trust in us, we can guarantee that these invaders will never bother another civilization again. 

Not wanting to wait for their reactions, the human warleader spoke on. You know as well as I do that these things can track us down. Theyre not random creatures. They like playing games, sure, but their final goal is killing. They can track life down across light centuries and hunt us like game ready for slaughter. Their fleet is massive and has never been seen entirely in one location. We know how this has to end. Either we all die, or someone makes a sacrifice for the possibility of survival for the others. Someone has to be that sacrifice. This is not up for debate, this is not going to be discussed. We are the ones being attacked now. Ive talked it over with authorities back home, and theyve approved it as well. I dont want any dissent here. Humanity will draw back, well lure them into one location. And there, once we know that the whole fleet is there, we fight. Most likely to the end. Maybe well make it, maybe we wont. But do us a favor: if we fail, get out. The one thing we can guarantee is that theyll be hung up around our planet for a while; prepare to evacuate now, and if we fail, go. Go away, go out somewhere, just go. Do not pity us, do not weep for us. This is for survival. Well do what we have to, and you should do what you have to do. 

As the translator speakers finished, the negotiation room erupted into shouts, objections, shock, awe, praise, ridicule, everything. The varying reactions could be seen: the Ytesh, ever pious and charitable, began a rising prayer chant. The Rishaad, Humanities oldest allies and friends, objected and offered what little they had left as a replacement. It was the militaristic and ever-suspicious Natlek who whispered to each other in hushed tones. 

Order was called by the Ytesh as their prayer ended. The Ytesh warleader had a look of solemn understanding as he said, I know your culture abandoned religion long ago, but please accept our prayer and best wishes for you in this life and the next.

The human warleader nodded in silent appreciation. The Rishaad spoke next.

Is there nothing we can do? Our entire navy is at your disposal. Anything we can do to stop this, we will. We have nothing left: let us be the ones to end this.

Your numbers are too few to lure them, and you are already beaten in their eyes. Take what you have and save it. Settle on the planets the Ytesh offered to us, or run. Save yourselves.

Bickering, shouting, prayers and whispers echoed through the chamber once more. Debating what to do, what to say, how to plan evacuations and movements. This time, the Natlek called order and broke the silence.

And how are we to know, if you are to fail, when you have failed?

Silence. The Natlek and human warleaders glared at each other. The Natlek were a infamously callous race, a military run regime that had perfected the art of war, both on the battlefield and in diplomacy. Naturally suspicious, they had laid down most of the guidelines for the war council, including the non-disclosure of names and the nine escorts that were required for each warleader. Their smooth skin and hunched gait only made them look more insidious to all of the races, a kind of ominous warlord. With their back crests extended, they looked ravenous. A slight shudder ran down the humans back, indiscernible to the other races but obvious to the escorts.

The Natlek continued, I thought so. You have no answer. We have yet to enable transmission at faster than light speed. So I propose a scout vessel, of which my species has many. They are small, agile crafts that can be self sustaining for up to a decade of your time. It will be manned by a representative of every other race, and its purpose will be to dash back to the council in the case of victory or defeat to report on the status and instigate our next course of action. Are there any objections?

The council chamber fell silent, until the Rishaad warleader said, I would like to volunteer to man this vessel.

Very well, the Natlek said, We shall arrange a party for you to lead. There is much else to plan as well. We should not waste any more time.

Kritush, the Natlek leader, was stereotypically suspicious. No being would be so selfless. There was something else going on. He was glad that a close ally of the humans would be leading the mission, but his own confidant would keep checks on the real situation. The humans had to be hiding something.

The meeting disbanded into a series of meetings, data transmissions, evacuation plans, and negotiation. It may very well be humanitys final hour.

___________________________________________________________________________

Forweth was impressed. So far, the humans had done nothing of suspicion, and had earned the trust and even admiration of the Natlek officer. With their primitive projectile, chemical, and crude nuclear weapons, they had managed to hold their own for two months. He had transmitted a data packet detailing this on his private channel, but it probably wouldnt reach homeworld for another week. They could jump back, but that would mean abandoning his purpose, and she had become strangely devoted to their original mission. She was inspired.

When the humans had first pulled back, most of the black fleet had followed them, picking off the transports that trailed behind. When the humans planted their feet in their homeworld, they drew a line and had held it. Only now, when the full might of the entire black fleet had descended upon their race, had the black fleet broken that line. They had to call in everything to do it, however; worlds were being scavenged and reclaimed as the fleet pulled away their defenses. Hope was high in other parts of the galaxy, but despite this valiant effort, it was clear that the humans would eventually yield. The official report had detailed this, but again, this probably would not arrive to the council for a few days.
Captain Falkrir had the helm. The Rishaan had introduced himself as a veteran with no family or purpose left, but Forweth knew otherwise. Kritush had given him a private briefing: this was the Rishaan warleader. He may be part of whatever the humans were planning. 

But so far, nothing had given Forweth cause for alarm, and he was happy to serve as Falkrirs backup. Mostly, Falkrir brooded, a sullen, silent glare at the devastation constantly unraveling before them. Who could blame him? The Rishaan had always been allies of the humans, and they were watching that race die.

The swirling clouds of the planet below them gave way only for moments to reveal the bright flashes and launches as weapons were fired and launched at the advancing tide. By now, most of the fighting was on the surface or in the atmosphere, the dark crafts having moved closer to deploy their brood as quickly as possible. Most of the battle was distant to the crew of the scout ship now, a light show viewed through the dark veil of space. The final motherships were advancing into the atmosphere, pushing wave after wave of humanoid soldiers and sleek fighters at the human resistance force. After a few hours, the final ship dipped beneath the clouds.

In front of Falkrir, the console dinged. A short range rapid transmission? Did the humans still have that capability? Falkrir accepted, and a human face filled the screen mounted in front of the viewport.

Warleader Falkrir. It has been an honor. Now, I do what I must. A handheld detonator was briefly visible as the human pulled it towards his face and triggered it.

Warleader Martinez..!

Falkrir was cut off as the screen turned to static. Three silent seconds passed.

And then the sky filled with fire.

______________________________________________________________________________

Rage? Sadness? Pain? Loss? How could Falkrir describe this feeling? He had been on the human homeworld before. It was a beautiful world of sweeping vistas and mountains, an irreplaceable world which had cradled the first race to make it to the stars. What would they do now?

The scout ship was too small to be majorly affected by the initial shockwave, and Forweth had taken the helm. Falkrir simply watched. They all had to pull back to lure the fleet in, but they could have saved some of them, established short range transports to get them off just in time, kicked them off and gotten them to

To where, exactly? The rest of the humans system was completely uninhabitable. All of the planets beyond their asteroid belt were uninhabitable gas giants. The asteroids themselves were small and bleak, fit for little but mining, and even that was a cruel existence. That left four planets. What about their first planet, the one they called Mercury? No- that was not an option. Mercury was a bleak ball of rock with a rotation too slow to establish reliable temperatures. Their fourth planet, perhaps? Not out of the question, but making it habitable would require years of dedicated work and effort. They didnt have the time.

His mind temporarily drifted to the third planet. No, that would be a fate worse than death. It was a hostile orb, glowing a deep blue color that only spoke of agony. The atmosphere was so hostile it had to be substituted, not filtered. Two thirds of the surface was covered in a roiling liquid that was impossible to transverse or build upon. The temperature range was tolerable at their equator but unbearable at the poles. Life would never survive there.

He sighed. What had the humans called their home? Ah yes.. Venus. Named after an ancient Goddess of beauty, apparently. And it truly had been beautiful. He almost cried out for knowing that it would never be seen again, and a human would never walk among the stars again. But there was nothing they could have done.

______________________________________________________________________________
   The big shots had gathered in Geneva for the spectacle, but Joseph Martinez preferred a simpler spectacle. Nikolai Williams, his friend and fellow officer, sat with him in the remote Canadian cabin. The remains of Venus floated on the viewscreen, being transmitted by their cloaked, remote probe. Nikolai shook his head.
	I would be lying if I told you I wouldnt miss the evening star. But that was an impressive plan. Killing two birds with one stone, eh?
	Joseph nodded. When the Rishaan had come into contact with an old junker around a hundred years ago, they thought it was a flagship. Not wanting to disclose their secret, humanity played along, acting as equals. But they were older, far older, and the central areas of the milky way were mapped and colonized by them. They had noticed the fledgling races, but paid them little heed; human methods of travel and transmissions were far too advanced to be picked up by primitive scanners. So they kept some visible ships, some visible colonies, made a show, but kept all of the real tech hidden. Played along, pretended to be even a bit primitive. They found other races, and found that all of their homeworlds were fairly similar to Venus. So they set up the largest extraterrestrial human colony there and convinced the other races that it was the human homeworld. They bought it.

   But the act got old. Humanity had bigger problems, was hungry for expansion, and wanted to observe in a non-obligatory capacity. So when the invaders came, it was a mixed blessing. All sentient life is precious, so they held off at first, but it soon became clear that something had to be done. When it finally happened, Venus was manned by automated systems controlled fro. earth. Not a single human had died in the explosion. Martinez had come close, but the cloaked blast pod did the job. Within minutes he had landed on his private launch pad in the Canadian wilderness.
     "Well, you saved the galaxy and got the xenos out of our hair, said Nikolai as he poured two glasses of whiskey. I think that warrants some celebration. To Joseph Martinez, the craftiest bastard I know.

I'll drink to that.

Hello! Ive only tried posting here once before, trying to start a series that was terribly written and an idea I couldnt follow through with. Since then my writing has improved(I hope) and I got an idea from The Last Humans.(https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2ulq2b/oc_the_last_humans/) I hope it turned out well, criticism welcome!
