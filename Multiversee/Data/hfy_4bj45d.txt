**Chapter 3**

The expeditionary crew stood looking out over the park in silence from the windows on the 15th floor of a derelict structure.  Near the center of the park was a circular area about a quarter mile in diameter where all structures and trees were razed to the ground.  The area almost appeared scorched, but it was too pristine.  In the center of the pad were two objects of vastly different size; a gargantuan sphere and a pyramid approximately three times taller than any member of the expeditionary crew.  Tif was pale and tight-lipped, arms outstretched and palms leaving condensation against the glass as he supported himself, despite his suit being climate controlled.  His legs were feeling weak and he couldnt shake a sense of profound confusion as his heart raced and his temperature rose.

&nbsp;

Dr. Vanseen? asked the Major again.

&nbsp;

Yes, Major, he replied hoarsely, licking his lips. I know what that is, but I dont understand.  Its not possible

&nbsp;

Well? the Major prodded, the rest of the crew looking eagerly at Tif who was shaking his head either in disbelief or to clear what he thought was faulty vision.

&nbsp;

Its a gravitational pulse generator; one of the beacons that was sent out during the second phase of the Peripheral Searches.  It shouldnt be here.

&nbsp;

Maybe one of them was kept on Haati as a monument? piped one of the corporals.

&nbsp;

No, replied Tif as he looked over the shoulder of MSgt Lihn at the ROVs display.  Thats a functioning model.  Look at the exhaust ports, he pointed.  There is residue around the periphery.  Look at the fuel rods; they have definitely been used because they are all different heights.  You can see evidence of impacts on the shielding.  This beacon was launched as part of the mission.

&nbsp;

So how did it get all the way back here? asked the corporal.  Tif shook his head and shrugged his shoulders as he went to key his microphone to hail Zin.  The Major stopped Tifs hand in mid-air and the doctor responded with a quizzical look.

&nbsp;

Not yet, the Major shook his head.  If you call in what weve found, this place will be swarming with vessels and civilians within minutes.  We have no idea what were walking into and if we stir something down there, a lot of people could get hurt or worse.  We need to proceed with extreme caution.

&nbsp;

Major, Im getting an energy signature from the site, interrupted MSgt Lihn.

&nbsp;

Nuclear? replied Major Yisan.

&nbsp;

No; not nuclear.  Otherwise the initial scans would have picked it up.  Its extremely-low frequency.

&nbsp;

Well, of course its ELF.  Its a gravity pulse generator, scoffed Tif.

&nbsp;

Im sure thats true, the MSgt replied coolly, but its not coming from the beacon.

Admiral Bidor stood on the bridge of his vessel, Core Alliance Ship Vigilant, exhausted but refusing to leave his post.  He hadnt slept more than a few hours since arriving in orbit above Haati.  His stomach was twisted and he felt a constant knot in his throat.  He could tell all of his subordinates were being very tender with him, and while he appreciated the sentiment, he wanted their focus on the task at hand.

&nbsp;

The door to the bridge slid open silently and Captain Farko came walking in with two cups of steaming brew.  One of the other few surviving Haati, Captain Farko was Bidors closest friend and confidant from before the Pelecrus War.  The Admiral took the cup gratefully and blew the steam from atop the fluid, looking thoughtfully into the mug where he noticed flakes of gold and black suspended in the liquid; the good Captain knew just what Bidor needed at a time like this.  The Admiral glanced at the Captains mug, taking note of the same gold and black flecks, then looking up to see an almost imperceptible smirk on Farkos face.  The Captain shrugged as if to say *Why not?*

&nbsp;

The Admiral drank deeply, the fluid warming his belly and Farkos addition working its way into his nervous system.  The Admirals feathers ruffled sharply as he felt renewal with every sip; his eyes regaining focus and his mind clearing away all but the mission.

&nbsp;

The bridge was bustling with activity; raw data pouring in from reconnaissance vessels around the planet.  Farko motioned for the Admiral to take reprieve from his vigil and accompany him to the Admirals private quarters.  Once there, the Admiral sat on the rim of his favorite chair and Farko leaned against a desk.

&nbsp;

Ok. You have my attention, Dax.  What is it? implored the Admiral.

&nbsp;

One of the expeditionary crews in Penkil found something; a gravity pulse generator from the second stage of the Peripheral Searches.

&nbsp;

Within city limits? the Admiral asked incredulously.

&nbsp;

Yes, in the geographic center; right in the middle of the Park.  It appears to be inactive, but it was definitely an active module at some point.

&nbsp;

So why hasnt there been official declaration from the ground crew.  Whats really going on?

&nbsp;

Well, Sir, the crew took note of extremely-low-frequency waves emanating from the site; the waves arent coming from the pulse generator, but rather some artifact-type structure next to it.  The commanding officer made direct contact with me and when I asked about the secrecy, he told me that something about the situation didnt sit right.  He wanted to make sure that the site was reconnoitered and secured before making a general announcement.  A lot of people could get hurt by rushing in to an odd scenario.

&nbsp;

Smart man.  Do you trust him? asked the Admiral as he sipped his brew.

&nbsp;

Yes, Sir.  Major Yisan and I have worked on spec-ops teams together before, including during the Pelecrus War.  Hes a clever man, and Ive got my life to show for it.  If he thinks we should keep this under wraps until he feels safe, my recommendation is to follow his lead.  The Admiral nodded thoughtfully as he took another sip.

&nbsp;

So be it.  Supply him with whatever tools, instruments, and personnel he needs.  Use your own discretion.

&nbsp;

Yes, Sir, Farko said, but as he turned to leave the Admirals quarters, the Admiral asked one more thing.

&nbsp;

Dax?  Farko turned to see the Admiral staring into his mug, now mostly empty.

&nbsp;

Sir?  There was a drawn out moment of silence.

&nbsp;

Have you thought about going down? he paused. Going home?

&nbsp;

Sir, Captain Farko said firmly, there is nothing for us on the surface.  If you want closure, it is not here.  Pitho has suffered our same fate, and there will likely be more attacks.  Closure for you and I will be to purge this threat before anyone else shares our loss.  That is the only way to honor the fallen.  As the words fell from his tongue, Captain Farko felt horrible for his stern tone.  He knew exactly how the Admiral felt, but it fell to the Captain to prop up the Admiral when he faltered.  The fleet needed strength and resolve during this time, and Farko knew that the Admiral needed the fleet just as desperately.

&nbsp;

Youre right, Dax.  Take care of this issue in Penkil, even if that means you have to go to surface.  I may call on you to do me a favor before we leave this planet. Farko shot the Admiral a look of apprehension.  Just keep me informed and Ill keep you supplied.
