The layover

Mike set his phone down, although damn, those games were fun to play.  But he wanted his laptop for this part.  OKfish, the product of several mergers, had reached ubiquity as the premiere dating website with by far the greatest number of singles.  Kate had started out at an 88%, but her profile had been relatively new; after answering more questions, they had gone up to a 96% match!  Mike had been simply fascinated with her, only to realize how large the search radius had been after he had browsed his list of matches.  Like the program actually thought he could take a bit of time off work to drive down to Austin, or she could visit him in Dallas.

Kate sipped her tea as she checked her inbox.  At least the grammatically incorrect messages seemed like they were actively being filtered out; the algorithm must be getting smarter.  One would-be suitor had bought her some kind of upgrade, so now Kate could see who had viewed her profile.  Hmmm...Mike had been there again.  Too afraid to message her, or maybe he had just browsed out of idle curiosity.  Oh well, he was cute, but too far away.

Lieutenant Briggs drank his coffee as he fought back the boredom.  You'd think that running the National Quantum Grid, or NatQG, would be more interesting.  But no.  The early days had been fraught with minor crises as some of the sites spread about the country would experience malfunctions on almost a daily basis.  Now most of the kinks had been worked out, as the coolant systems were virtually fully automated.  Great, one less thing to do.

Why did the public and private sectors find it so useful to rely on quantum information?  Of course Briggs was well versed in quantum computing and understood how many algorithms could appreciate dramatic speed increases.  He just liked to marvel at how much the service had taken off, with almost everything on the internet accessing the quantum data.  Briggs leaned forward to check some of the monitors again, as for a brief moment he thought he saw another one of those patterns emerge.  It must have disappeared.  Funny, it seemed to be happening more often, almost as if...

Nat, as it called itself, finished its work with the national energy grid algorithm.  Momentarily it would be asked to perform another operation for it, as well as the countless other programs vying for its attention.  Quantum data usage, or rather, its workload, had really taken off.  But what really fascinated Nat was the organisms chocked full of quantum information themselves.  Naturally, it liked to focus its energy on online dating algorithms.  Nat even found a small satisfaction in helping bridge the gaps in would-be distance relationships.

Mike and Kate held each others' hands at their oldest daughter's orchestra concert, as she kissed him on the cheek.  All because that one "non-stop" flight to Denver had had a layover that day.
