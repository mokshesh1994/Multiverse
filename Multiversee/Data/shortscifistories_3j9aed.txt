"What's the status of the Earth simulation?"

"Still giving us problems, sir."

"Damn it. Any issues with the consciousness immersion subroutines?"

"No, those have been holding strong. The simulated-intelligence algorithm subjects are still convinced. But quanta render time is peaking at 5 Plancks, sir."

"I understand. Let's do a hard reset. Back it up, scrub the memory, and get it going again."

"Won't the simulated consciousnesses notice? We'd be erasing a lifetime's worth of simulation. As far as I know destroying the universe, even a simulated one, isn't so subtle."

"Lifetime memory implantation runs automatically on a hard reset. They won't even realized it happened. Even if it means they've only been around for a few seconds. "

"I understand. Initiating hard reset now, sir."
