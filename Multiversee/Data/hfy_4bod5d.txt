[OC] Flesh and Metal
kosmoceratops1138
The gentle humming of the Thireefk exploratory ships many consoles comforted the crew. They were around a new planet, with a new, unfamiliar, hostile environment, but the ship was the same, gentle and calm. At the moment, they had no duties, only waiting for their scout to come back with a report.

Breathlessly, the scour barged into the room. He was out of breath, as if he had been running, and a look of fear was contorted into his blue face. A data crystal was gripped in his claws.

What reports do you bring? Asked the captain, but the scout only wordlessly shoved him aside and jammed the crystal into the console. The view of the planet melted away, leaving the access menu of the crystal.

This is a juvenile of the dominant species on the planet.

A face slowly melted into view, and the crew gasped. That was not a face. That was a hideous amalgamation of being and machine, a contorted glimmer of what life should be. The thing was showing bits of bone through what could only be its mouth, and chunks of metal were fused to each one, string together by wires. From the sides of the opening protruded arcs of metal that looped back behind the things head. The sensory organs, positioned above the maw, were scrunched and filled with liquid, and the muscles of the face contorted in horrendous agony.

Some recoiled, some looked away. This was an insult to nature, against every tenant that civilized races should hold. 

This picture is a still from a short video gathered by our hidden cameras. The rest of the footage is not pretty. For those that are faint of heart, I recommend that you leave the room.

Some stood and left as the face melted away. A video began to play. The thing was standing about a meter away, its contorted face sitting atop a stout, robust body. As the crew watched, it clawed at the metal on itself, leering into the camera, emitting a wailing shriek that caused the crew to tighten their vibration suppressing robes tighter around themselves. There was something larger rising besides it. In the blinding rage, the young one hit this thing, continuing with its wailing call. And then, it looked directly at the camera. An appendage raised up and filled the screen, blotting out the view as it turned to static.

When this transmission was sent to me, I left the planet as fast as I could, the scout explained, shivering. This is a barbaric, warlike race. From what I can gather, they weld metal to themselves to weight them down and inflict pain, so that they may be filled with rage in addition to training for the harshest conditions. I motion we leave this planet, forget it ever existed. And if they ever make it out of their system with such a culture, we destroy them.

The bridge filled with whispers of agreement as the captain gave the orders to move out.

Edith Johnson, age 6, hated the tooth man. Her parents forced her to go there and she returned with bad things on her face. It wasnt fair!

 Mommy took her to the park but it still hurt! She couldnt be happy at the park with this stupid thing on her!

Mommy take it off! She wailed, tugging at mommys dress, Take it off take it off!

Stop that! This is the park, dont you want to have fun? Go over there, Im sure theres something fun!

She turned around and saw a tree. But something wasnt right about it She tapped it. It felt different.

Oh well, its probably nothing, she thought. What was that? A birdy? Follow the birdy, birdy, birdy!

I posted a longer, serious story yesterday, so I hope this doesn't feel like I'm spamming content. This one is largely different from From The Abyss, so I hope it seems different enough.
