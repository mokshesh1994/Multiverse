**Chapter 4**

The crew made their way carefully through the park towards the beacon.  Silence reigned as the marines stalked, checking every angle and straining at every sound.  Tif felt a nausea that he couldnt quite place, and as they drew nearer to the epicenter, the nausea worsened.  This only served to support his conclusion that the ELF waves were distorting his equilibrium.  The very ground they walked on seemed animated; not quite tremors but not still.

&nbsp;

One of the engineers that had stayed at the observation point inside the skyscraper, Coporal Golt, was hailed over the secure comm-channel by Major Yisan.

&nbsp;

Corporal Golt, are you reading telemetric data from my suit? the Major asked.

&nbsp;

Yes, Sir.  Im trying to write an algorithm to counteract the electromagnetic radiation, but it varies as a function of distance, so its taking a little longer than I had anticipated, replied the corporal.

&nbsp;

I think well wait here until you finish, the Major signaled a halt.  The nausea is difficult to work through and still stay situationally aware.  Hurry up, please, Mr. Golt.

&nbsp;

Im pushing a firmware update to your suit now, Major.  Let me know if the nausea persists.  With a small confirmation chirp and a blast of cool air on his face, the Major suddenly felt at ease.

&nbsp;

That seemed to do the trick, Corporal.  Upload the firmware to the C.A.S. Vigilant and notify Captain Farko to push the firmware discreetly to all planet-bound suits.

&nbsp;

Yes, sir.

&nbsp;

Ok, Ladies and Gentlemen, lets advance, ordered the major.

&nbsp;

Major? implored Tif.  Might I have a word?  Major Yisan looked skeptically at Tif before motioning to MSgt Lihn to hold the perimeter while he stepped aside to converse with the linguist.

&nbsp;

What is it, Doctor?

&nbsp;

Honestly, Major, I think it would be in the best interest of this expedition to open a secure communication channel with Dr. Quitats team and request a rendezvous.  The doctor scratched absently at his ear, despite the helmet being in the way.

&nbsp;

Doctor, you do recall that we had this conversation earlier, do you not?  Im maintaining secrecy for a reason.  Tif was beginning to become exasperated.

&nbsp;

Major, I understand your motives, but I must strenuously suggest that Dr. Quitat be present for this contact.

&nbsp;

You got a hard on for your boss, Doctor? the Major quipped and a few of the operators chuckled.  Tifs demeanor changed from one of pleasantries to indignation.

&nbsp;

Our relationship is strictly professional, Major, Tif said flatly.  Dr. Quitat was on the team that designed the beacons.  She helped to write the code that dictated the ELF gravitational emanation pattern.  The Peripheral Searches were literally founded on her expertise, so Id say she has as much right to be here as anyone.  If you want answers about how or why this beacon is here, shes your best shot.

&nbsp;

Alright, alright, Doctor.  Relax.  Well coordinate to get them over here and co-op, the Major gave a sly grin and just as he reached for the comm button on his helmet, he couldnt help but let one more comment fly.  She does have a great ass for a Veldian, though.   Tif blushed.  Dr. Zin Quitat, this is Major Turt Yisan. Come in, please.

&nbsp;

Go ahead, Major, came the reply.

&nbsp;

Please switch to frequency, he paused as he looked at his armband, One point six two Golf for secure communication.  He nodded for Tif to tune to that channel as well.

&nbsp;

Im here, Major, came Zins reply.  What have you found?  The major gestured for Tif to take the reins.

&nbsp;

Zin, its Tif.  Look, Ill get right to it.  Theres a grav-beacon in the middle of Unity Park.  Its not art; it was definitely one of the models sent out during the second phase of the Searches.

&nbsp;

How, she interrupted, but Tif cut her off.

&nbsp;

Theres ELF radiation emanating from the site, but were fairly certain that the beacon isnt the source.  Theres a smaller structure next to the beacon, but we cant tell what it is and were not sure if thats what is generating the waves.  I think you should be here with your crew to help us with this.  The Major broke into the conversation.

&nbsp;

This discovery is under complete secrecy and I have authorization all the way from the top to treat this situation how I see fit.  Your crew will merge with mine and will be under strict orders to maintain radio silence outside our local channel.  I appreciate that science will give us the answers that we need, but operations will be under my direct control.  Clear?

&nbsp;

Yes, Major.  Where would you like us?  asked Dr. Quitat.

&nbsp;

Rendezvous is the skyscraper at the intersection of Ring-Road 3 and the Southern path in one hour.  Well be waiting on the 15th floor.  Give no information to your crew other than your destination, in case you get separated.  Ill brief everyone when you arrive.

&nbsp;

I dont like keeping my team in the dark, Major, Zin spoke confidently.

&nbsp;

I appreciate that, Doctor.  All the more reason for you to make it here before dusk. Yisan out.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sir? Farko called to the Admiral over the private comm-link.

&nbsp;

Yes, Captain?

&nbsp;

The area has been swept and found clean all except the interior.  The Admiral began preparations for transit to the surface without a word.  The silence aggravated the usually calm Captain Farko.  May I speak freely, Sir?

&nbsp;

Go ahead, Dax.

&nbsp;

Sir, you will not find closure here.  I can go inside and collect your things.  I know your house as well as my own; just tell me what to take and Ill save you the trip.

&nbsp;

Im coming down, Dax, the Admiral replied as he neared his shuttle.

&nbsp;

Dammit, Hil, why are you doing this to yourself?  We need you clear-headed!

&nbsp;

Dax, the Admiral replied meekly, I need this.  Its been three long years.  I need to see my home.

&nbsp;

No matter what you expect to see, it will not be this.  The area is overgrown.  This is no longer your home.  This will not be a memory you wish to keep, Hil.  Please, trust me.  Silence as the shuttle departed C.A.S. Vigilant.  The Admiral refused to be swayed.  Desperate for some way to get through, Farko blurted out his truth.  I went home, Hil, he admitted.

&nbsp;

What? the Admiral coughed.  When? Why didnt you say anything?  he demanded, but the Captains reply came slowly.

&nbsp;

About ten months after the event.  I know I broke a lot of rules, but at the time I didnt care.  I didnt poke around.  I went straight home, but there was nothing.  The Admiral considered his friends words carefully.

&nbsp;

I understand, Dax, he said gently.

&nbsp;

No, Hil.  You dont.  The emptiness is staggering.  I know that I cannot change your mind, you damned fool.  No one couldve changed mine.  Farko choked up.  Its just that my heart breaks for you because I know you will not find what you are looking for.  The memories that you hold now, of your home when you last saw it, will be forever overwritten by what you find here.

&nbsp;

I accept that conclusion, Dax, the Admiral said softly as his shuttle landed on the path to the base of his Home-tree.  He exited the craft and began up the walkway to where the Captain and his security team stood.

&nbsp;

Im sorry, Hil, Captain Farko said as the Admiral approached, his head hung low and eyes a pale shade of themselves.  The Admiral placed a clawed hand on Farkos shoulder as he passed, noting that the Captains feathers seemed unusually flat.

&nbsp;

The Admiral had walked up the spiral staircase inside the trunk of his Home-tree and now stood at the entry door, hand on the knob, but frozen in anticipation.

&nbsp;

*Am I prepared for what I may find?* he wondered.

&nbsp;

Quickly, he turned the knob and pushed, but the door was locked.  He reached into his breast-pocket and retrieved a small key, inserting it into the lock on the door.  Considering how long it had been since the door was used, it swung open with relative ease.  The musty odor of years of abandonment assaulted his nostrils as his eyes adjusted to the dark of the dwelling.  The home was in perfect order; not a chair out of place, nor a parcel on the floor.  The table had been set in anticipation and fine dcor was put out on the counter-tops.  Pictures littered the walls, but they were dull and drab; entirely devoid of warm colors and the life they had once brought to the home.

&nbsp;

The Admirals feathers quivered uncontrollably as he made his way past his bedroom to the nursery.  There he felt the anxiety of an anticipated but eternally unrealized gift and he broke down into a fit of uncontrollable sobbing.  When he regained his composure, he rummaged through his bedroom to collect some personal affects; his war-bow and mace, his wifes favorite necklace which she rarely wore because she thought it was too nice, and the blanket for his unborn child, woven by Daxs wife.  All else he left untouched.

&nbsp;

When he returned to the main living area, he found Dax waiting near the entryway with a solemn expression.

&nbsp;

You were right, the Admiral spoke hoarsely.  There is no resolution for me here.  The Admirals mace fell to the floor with a thud and the two men shared an embrace of understanding, sorrow, and resolve.  When they broke the embrace and left the Home-tree, Bidor spoke dryly, Let us finish with Haa'ti.  Gather the teams.  We go to Pitho.  Captain Farko offered a solution to the warriors present as a remedy for the palpable sorrow.

&nbsp;

Let the hunt begin, Farko commanded his men and all present let out a war-shriek that could turn the blood of any enemy to stone.
