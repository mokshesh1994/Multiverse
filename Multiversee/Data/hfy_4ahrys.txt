A Request for Some Death Worlds
H_SG
*Some background first: A friend and I are playing NationStates and roleplaying different human civilisations in a league of humanity known as the Solarian Commonwealth. I am a left-wing utopia with a bloated but congenial constitutional monarchy, he is basically The Empire from Warhammer 40K. He sent me a request for some death worlds in my territory in which to build penal colonies.*

To the Representative of His Excellency, The Holy Emperor, Ruler of Humanity in General and The Imperium of Man in Particular,

Her Majestys Bosveldian Government is pleased to present a number of potential deathworlds in our interstellar holdings ranging from level 8 to level 12 hazards (according to the Savage-Grylls scale). Following discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Unusual Revenues we may cordially offer ex-territoriality agreements for said holdings to allow whichever disciplinary actions and "care" which your government deems "humane".

The Research and Explorations Council on Deathworlds (hereafter referred to as RECD) of the Department of Interstellar Holdings has compiled a shortlist of potential locations for your perusal:

##**Diepsloot 7**

Diepsloot 7 is the seventh moon of the gas giant Diepsloot in the Nieuw Afrika system. This supergiant moon has a dense atmosphere consisting mostly of nitrogen and nitrogenous compounds with a barely sufficient level of oxygen at median surface height. This results in severe nitrogen narcosis for individuals unfortunate enough to lose their respirators.

As Diepsloot 7 is tidally locked with Diepsloot the day lasts half a year on the moon which is 137 standard Earth days. The craggy landscape is near molten during the day season while roving glaciers during the night season strip the landscape of all surface features. Due to the severe gravitational stresses exerted by Diepsloot on the moon, it also experiences hypervolcanism. At the terminator severe katabatic storms mark the boundary between day and night. The only permanent habitation on the planet is a small space pad and research station located at a constantly illuminated spire near the north pole.

Research is focused on a unique polymer eating fungus which is the only life found on the moon, it's mechanism of evolution is yet to be understood, though current research indicates it may be a forgotten bioweapon. The Department of Shadow Projects has refused to respond to queries and we are still awaiting arbitration from the Department of Interdepartmental Relations.

RECD believes that survival on the surface without equipment has a 50% lethality rate after 9 hours and a 50% chance of the greatest Mad Max homage of all time.

##**Jakaranda - "Oranjeland"**

A result of a failed social experiment in shipping all our extremists to their own planet and forgetting about them. Jakaranda, or Oranjeland as the inhabitants call it is a small but incredibly dense planet in the Praetervaal system. The planetary density is a result of an abnormally high concentration of toxic heavy metals in the crust. This gives the planet an almost jewel like colouration from orbit due to the unique biochemistry of its plant and animal life. However the atmosphere, water, soil, plants, and animal all contain lethal levels of heavy metals which cause irreversible progressive mental dementia and death within weeks from enzymic deactivation.

The inhabitants are mostly subterranean dwelling with one significant domed settlement over what they call "Die Myn". The inhabitants are virulently xenophobic and racist. It generally takes several years for the Department of Census to hire researchers of suitable genetic stock to allow them to safely evaluate the planetary population; the hazard pay is excellent. RECD researchers are currently unsure if the political affiliation of the populace is truly due to inherent beliefs or as a result of mild heavy metal poisoning, further research has resulted in too many casualties to continue.

Animal life is explosively active on the planet, the heavy metals in addition to the highly UV active Praetervaalian sun results in rapid genetic mutation. Large creatures are rare due to the extreme virulence of native bacteria, but those that do exist are deadly and almost impossible to kill. The Hexalion is the apex predator of the planet, weighing in at 780 standard kilograms. Its hide-scales are made of beryllium arsenide, whose stunningly toxic properties are what is believed to allow it to survive the biological environment of the planet. Researchers from the Department of The Royal Menagerie have stated that once they learnt its saliva was hydrogen cyanide they decided that orbital monitoring was sufficient for the species.

Several individuals of questionable survival instincts have taken to hunting hexalions for their hides as beryllium arsenide has continued to elude industrial synthesis. They are extremely territorial and extended heavy metal poisoning has rendered them extremely paranoid, they should be avoided even more so than the average Oranjelandian citizen. To the consternation of the Department of Royal Continuance, Her Majesty has expressed great interest in hunting a hexalion and adding it to her trophy collection.

##**Sizwe #ZZ0385468**

This large planetoid may be considered an embarrassing Royal folly, the previous Borena feared foreign aggression and directed the Department of Shadow Projects to evaluate the construction of a "Death Star". The current Minister of War at the time reacted somewhat overzealously and directed the Department of Shadow Projects to evaluate construction by actually constructing it. A suitable planetoid was towed into deep space and construction began on hollowing out the nickel-iron core and using it to construct an outer armour layer.

The project was stopped once the Borena discovered that several Gross System Products were being diverted to the Department of Shadow Projects for the aforementioned construction.

Sizwe #ZZ0385468 as it is known by its budget code is now a mildly radioactive honeycomb in near absolute zero deep space. Its thermal profile is identical to the surrounding space, making it essentially impossible to discover without exact coordinates, near the core some heat is available from the decay of the massive fission piles which were to power the planet. However radiation levels are much higher with almost non-existent gravity in the region near the core. It appears that these conditions have morphed the small pests which came with the construction workers into strange and mysterious ambush predators and an environment similar to that within deep ocean trenches. The primary food supply in this system is mutated fungi and lichens which feed upon gamma radiation emitted by the core reactors.

The biomechanical probes which were sent in the last few years succumbed quickly to fungal growths, leading RECD researches to believe that the limited biomatter on the planetoid has resulted in the primary food source being hypercompetitive in digesting it. We have the first recorded case of flesh eating fungi; one researcher before being promoted to Department head quipped, "It doesn't sound like a fun guy.

We hope that these exciting samples may give you a taste of what we have to offer in terms of otherwise unwanted real-estate. We look forward to hearing from your and establishing a reasonable rate of exchange. Please refrain from making this communiqu public as the Xeno Alliances already think were slightly demented.
