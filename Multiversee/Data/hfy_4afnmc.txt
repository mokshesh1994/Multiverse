*There exists in the universe no beauty more visceral than a human living battlecruiser dancing through the remnants of its enemies. - Litathomm, Prime Loremaster of the Korcar Collective*

&nbsp;

Several alarms chimed as a new target appeared on the passive sensor net.  Green and blue icons flashed across the screen before Augor Cag Balrcaugl, and he grinned toothily at his watch compatriots.  Orchath, second of the watch and almost as veteran as Cag himself, sniffed his nonchalance. However, for the newest member of the crew and the final third of the current watchs three member party, this could be the first time the youngling saw action, and Caelaur was physically bouncing in his seat. Cag put together a brief report and sent the notification to the ships Praetor with practiced ease, adding a wink to encourage Caelaurs enthusiasm in the process. 

&nbsp;

Boys, looks like we have a juicy one.

&nbsp;

Angorir-3 was a fairly generic gas giant in a backwater system.  By itself, it would not have been worthy of much notice--the gaseous fuel reserves in its considerable atmospheric bulk were too low by density to be economically viable for an extraction station, and the Imperial forces distractions in other parts of the galaxy ensured that policing this area would be minimal. In addition, only three charted jump points existed in the system, one of which led to uninhabited reaches of space.  It was the other two jump points, and the fact that Angorir lay between them, that brought *Detuas Revenge* to this backwater gas giant in recent times.  Thanks to astrography, Angorir-3 was within easy striking distance of any ship that transited between the two jump points, and would remain so for several spans.  The privateers had aggressively (and effectively) exploited this situation for the better part of a microcycle now, offloading vast treasures of supplies and equipment liberated from passing traders headed for the few border planets on the frontier past Angorir.  

&nbsp;

A-...Augor Ba-Balrcaugl? The youths shaky voice was slightly trembling, undoubtedly in part from excitement as well as from trepidation over what was coming. Cag looked at Caelaur, amusement filling him as he observed the tense, blue-flushed mess of tendrils on the rookies head.  The rookies could never truly contain their emotional color flushes their first tour out here. To Caelaurs credit, only the slightest tinges of red marred his tendrils to show the fear underlying the anticipatory blue.  

&nbsp;

Yes, Cael? Cag encouraged gently, when his watchmate did not continue with his speech.  

&nbsp;

T-there are some weird readings here.  Why is the density so...erratic? The rookie was right, of course.  That was one of the first things that Cag had picked up on, a bright blue indicator amidst the more satisfactory green scanner results.  

&nbsp;

A lot of species use ships with moving parts, cylinders and circle gravity generators and the like.  The erratic readings are showing some kind of movement, probably from a fairly unique life support requirement. 

&nbsp;

The rookie nodded at Cags explanation, but after a moment continued.  It just seems strange, is all.  I cant put my finger on it.

&nbsp;

Dont worry about it. The other readings are in line with standard freighting definitions--see this one? And this one?  The engine power emissions are far too weak to be anything military grade at that thermal reading.  These splotches? Cag indicated another blue light pulsing irregularly. That might be some kind of liquid containment.  Its probably headed to Shaliae--we picked off more than one food and water transport headed there before you came aboard.

&nbsp;

Caelaur nodded again, looking relaxed after that response.  The three settled into pre-action operations, getting the bridge of the *Revenge* ready for Praetor Elurtu and the rest of the executive team to assume command in the attack.  Hiding in the shadow of the gas giant had certain advantages.  Almost none of their prey ever knew they were there until it was far too late, offering the privateers the privilege of careful preparation before every strike. This meant that while two of the three discovering watchmembers were entitled to be on the bridge during the event, the third would be bumped off to make room for members of higher seniority.  As Caelaur prepared to leave, tendrils gone purple from disappointment, Cag stopped him.  Ill take off this time, Cael.  The rookies vivid blue shift was so dramatic that even Cags tendrils shined a bit white from a mixture of pride and embarrassment.  The exchange enlarged a few eyelids with curiosity, but otherwise no one paid it much heed.  It was, by all available sensor readings, going to be a fairly straightforward slaughter, and Cag certainly was not the first senior officer to let a subordinate get some bridge experience on a routine attack.  Cag gave the rookie and the rest of the bridge crew present another toothy grin, and took his leave.  It would be several microspan yet until anything happened anyway, and he was sure that he would be needed to help offload some of the cargo haul.  At several eights of millions of tons it was a big mark, roughly three times the size of the *Revenge* herself.  It might even have a decent sized number crew to commandeer for sapience brokering, if they were lucky enough to have stumbled upon an agri-production ship. Cag did not get his hopes up though--not many races ran with the mobile farming ships, and most of those were far bigger than what they were showing on the readings.  

&nbsp;

The Augor wandered through the bowels of the ship, past heavy metallic pipes and life support structures and tanks.  Discovering a potential mark always brought the ship to a strange schedule--the raw distances involved in space meant that a call to martial readiness would not need to begin for quite some time, but the standard watch schedule was completely forsaken as various officers jostled to be among those who would see action.  This left those like Cag free to do as they pleased, so he let his mind wander as he himself was doing physically.  

&nbsp;

The *Detuas Revenge* was a marvel of engineering beauty and--more importantly--it was an Erotur class Assault Cruiser.  Unlike most pirates and scoundrels of the galaxy, the Engoi that crewed the *Revenge* enjoyed the support of their native government, albeit at arms length.  The Engoi species had long presented itself to the galaxy (and the Imperium in particular) as fiercely independent, and unable to control the wilder members who sought a predatory style of existence.  The truth was more nuanced. Privateer franchises were some of the most powerful social institutions, with the greatest crews enjoying a popular support on Engor comparable to a blend of sports fanaticism and hero worship. This was reinforced on a regular basis by various scoreboards and competitions for seizures of cargo, sapients, and (in the case of one cyclical competition) size of local defense response eluded.  

&nbsp;

Almost a macrocycle ago, the *Detuas Revenge* had been among the best of the best, feared and loathed across a dozen sectors of space and showered with the praise of fellow Engoi.  That lasted until a run-in with an Imperial task force destroyed much of the former ship and a large portion of the crew...including the commanding Praetor. It had taken all of the surviving crews combined accumulated political and societal goodwill to rebound. Initially the rebound looked promising--they scored an Erotur hot off the production line. The new Erotur class Assault Cruiser boasted eight heavy plasma cannons, sixteen missile tubes, and enough shield generation capacity to weather an Imperial military junctions massed weapon systems. Unfortunately, after the loss, they found themselves anathema to those with the truly lucrative contracts, in addition to being commanded by a timid Praetor who managed to give them a laughingstock reputation before they spaced him.  For the past several cycles, the *Detuas Revenge* had drifted around in the last of the eight professional tiers, barely even worth mentioning in the update scans back on Engor.  After this past microcycles string of successes however, they had shot back up to the second tier, and with any luck, they would soon be once again competitive for the best military and black operations contracts.  Cags grin broadened in unison with his thoughts, even allowing a brief flash of white pleasure to show on his tendrils. Unlike many of his colleagues, who considered color flushing to be gross breach of decorum, the Augor refused to completely hide his emotions.  After all, growing pale might be mandatory, but growing grey is optional!  He couldnt help but let out a chuckle--

&nbsp;

A klaxon sounded.  

&nbsp;

Cag frowned at the interruption to his thoughts, before confusion replaced his annoyance.  It was a call for immediate martial readiness, insistent and overwhelming.  Deep orange lights came alive on the speakers up and down each hallway, and the casual crew movements from moments before were replaced with frantic scrambling.  Muscle memory spurred Cag onward as he dashed to the armory, vacuum suit on and adjusted before the nearby rookies were even halfway in their own.  

&nbsp;

The ship shuddered from the blow of some heavy impact.  Cag was thrown into the wall to his right as the entirety of existence shifted with monumental devastation.  The void of space stared back at him as his eyes looked on, unable to process the reality of the bodies of his former crewmates floating.  His arm was somehow latched onto a cable, anchoring him to the half of the ship he happened to be in.  He felt a strange calm as the artificial gravity died, and watched wreckage drift by.  As he finally started to get a grip on his senses, he took stock of the situation.  The *Revenge* had been cleaved in the middle, and the oblong half-oval pieces slowly twisted and spread as the gravity of Angorir-3 began to exert its will on wreckage.  The back half of the ship was in front of him, debris moving around of various speeds and and sizes.  Breathing in deeply in an attempt to control his racing double heartbeat, he was immensely grateful that he had reacted fast enough to get the suit on.  He idly wondered how many others had been as fortunate.  

&nbsp;

A bright flash filled his vision, silent in the vacuum, as the half of the *Revenge* he was looking at was obliterated before his eyes.  

&nbsp;

Cag willed his body to action as self-preservation kicked in and a plan began to form. Pull on the cable, return down the hallway, move to the ships emergency shuttles in the anterior hanger, escape.  The back of his mind marveled at the small twist of fate that saved the half of this ship containing the emergency shuttles.  The back half had not been equipped with any, and any survivors over there would have suffered a horrendous fate as gravity and the poisonous atmosphere of the gas giant began their gruesome work.

&nbsp;

He quickly maneuvered through the ship, all gas and gravity gone, praying to the Eight that they spare his life. By some miracle or another, he made it intact to the hanger bay.  The few survivors there were testament to how brutally efficient the surprise attack had been.  He saw among those present his watchmate Orchath, head tendrils poking around his face behind his faceplate, vivid red in fear.  The red was mirrored across the hanger--the Engoi were always the ones ambushing, not the other way around.  Cag worked his way towards his watchmate, voracious for any hint of knowledge about what had happened.

&nbsp;

It is a monster. 

&nbsp;

What?

&nbsp;

A monster.... From the black.  A fandui.  Maybe... even Fanguirngorir itself. Orchath turned to face Cag through their faceplates with eyes as empty as the void of which he spoke.  No mortal can stand before judgment.

&nbsp;

Are you telling me the Prince of Demons destroyed our ship?

&nbsp;

Orchath shrugged, struggling to find words amidst his shock.  We...we pinged it with the active sensors.  Thought it was impossible for it to escape.  A humorless chuckle left his mouth. Escape. It..it jumped through space. 

&nbsp;

What do you mean, Orch? Jumped how? Like a intrasystem jump gate? 

&nbsp;

Orchath shrugged again. One moment it was eight hundred thousand marks away.  The next, it was exactly 114.3 thousand marks away.  

&nbsp;

Cag was stunned.  That precision indicated that whatever it was that attacked them, it was not only able to jump across an incredibly narrow distance with precision (cosmically speaking). It knew the targeting ranges and capabilities of the *Revenge* so perfectly that they would have had almost no chance of landing a strike.... And it had landed two strikes with such perfect precision that it completely annihilated over half of the ship.  Still, something had to be done.  It was possible that its jump or weapons had a cool down period, or it could not make a jump with precision at these short distances, or He looked around, realization dawning on him that he was the senior officer present.  It was unfortunately likely that the others had been on the bridge, and the bridge was directly in the middle of the ship

&nbsp;

Pushing unwanted implications out of his mind, he asked the question he had been dreading.

&nbsp;

Did Cael make it? Orchath shook his head.  It was decided then.

&nbsp;

Everyone to the shuttles! Cag bellowed across the hanger. He was about to start ushering others when Orchath stopped him.  

&nbsp;

Wait, Cag.  I saw it. 

&nbsp;

What do you mean, you saw it?

&nbsp;

Orchaths eyes focused and burned deep into Cags own.  I saw it.  After the sensors got a good look, right before it...jumped.  I saw it, Cag.  It...its organic.

&nbsp;

Cag shook his head, refusing to believe his old comrade, but Orchath continued, getting increasingly frantic.  I saw it, and it jumped, and I ran, Cag.  *I RAN*.  His tendrils were deeply red now, emotions as raw and painful as they could possibly show.  Cag, unsure of how to respond but unable to allow any delays in their possible escape, grabbed Orchath and started pulling him along through the zero gravity, as the protestations came to the verge of violence.  

&nbsp;

Everyone, aboard, NOW! Cags force of personality was brought to bear against his old friend and the others in the hanger.  It took moments, precious moments, to get them loaded, but finally all of the former crew of the *Revenge* were aboard three of the emergency vessels.  They launched from the hangar bay, into space.

&nbsp;

It was waiting for them.  

&nbsp;

Unbelievable beauty.  That was the first thing that cross Cags mind.  An unparalleled beauty, combined with the most primal and inescapable sense of power.  It had eight tentacles divided into two rings, one fore and one aft.  The four tentacles in each ring were spaced equidistant around the main body.  Up and down the body and tentacles were some of the most stunning displays of bioluminescence Cag had ever seen--reds and blues and greens, more vivid even than the legendary Nderi fish of his homeworld, considered galaxy-wide to be one of the most visually striking creatures in existence.  As Cag looked on, flashes of white started at the tips of the tentacles and rapidly spread along to the core of the body and along the hull, dozens of streaks of bioluminescent lightning strikes.  Certain he was about to meet his doom but unable to look away, Cag witnessed reality itself seeming to warp; the tentacles undulating and propelling the creature forward at impossible speeds. The grace with which it effortlessly traversed the void took his breath away. Barely comprehending what he was watching, Cag took several moments to realize that the creature was heading directly for them. 

&nbsp;

To the three lifeboats of the pirate vessel *Detuas Revenge*, surrender immediately.

&nbsp;

The voice over the communications array was sudden and unannounced, causing everyone in Cags boat to jump with a start.  They all looked at each other dumbly, uncertain exactly  how the hail had come across without someone on their end allowing it.  

&nbsp;

To the three lifeboats of the wanted pirate vessel *Detuas Revenge*, respond immediately with surrender or forfeit your existence.

&nbsp;

Cags numbness was quickly turned to cold awareness that the others were looking at him to lead them.  He made his way to the comm station, and responded to the hail.  

&nbsp;

This is Augor Balrcaugl, of the *Detuas Revenge*. I speak for all three of our surviving lifeboats. He swallowed and awaited the judgment his next words would bring.  I offer our surrender to you, unknown vessel.

&nbsp;

Augor Balrcaugl of the *Detuas Revenge*, this is Captain William Roberts of the Human Alliance Living Battlecruiser *Literani*.  You are hereby formally charged with piracy, murder, slave trading, and evasion of lawful authority.  You will be taken aboard the *Literani* and delivered to the appropriate courts to stand trial.  Cut your engines and prepare to be eaten.
