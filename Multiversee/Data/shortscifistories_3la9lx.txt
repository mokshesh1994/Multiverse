The Decline and Fall of Road Cycling 2020 - 2093: Epilogue: The Turning Point

"Torn carbon lay scattered over the now smooth cobbles; it was unclear what was once bike and what was once limb. The towering advertising screens bathed a knot of man and machine in a full spectrum of light. A cry of 'who didn't take their stims?' came from the roaring crowd, faces gazing in wonder at the carnage before them. It was this scene that made me reevaluate the sport, and what it had become. 

"A search for ever increasing marginal gains resulted in amputations and surgery to remove excess tissue, limbs replaces by shafts of increasingly complex carbon structures. Hell, nutrition wasn't even a factor anymore with everyone running off of chemicals piped directly into the blood. This was no longer sport, it was science. A pet project by rich corporations competing to better each other with technological, chemical and biological advancements.

"I looked at my heroes being picked off the ground and lowered onto their replacement bikes: lower legs and arms blending seamlessly into crank and handlebars; pipes protruding from gut, jugular and windpipe; head encased in a smart alloy. This wasn't something to aspire to, these men were merely engines."
