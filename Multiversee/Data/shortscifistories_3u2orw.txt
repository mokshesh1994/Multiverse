Quantum or not?

Quantum or not?  We argued forever.  Whether or not to capture the randomness of the universe in our dream.  How could I know you'd be waiting?

It was done and life sprung forth.  A planet inside a computer.  To answer the burning questions about ourselves.  You were already old, the particles funneled in from our galaxy.

The consciousness we couldn't code.  We had to build the world around you.  To capture you in silicon.  Though we knew we could never fully understand.

When your home looked like ours, we went in and talked.  We listened to the wisdom of your race, your knowledge spreading beyond the confines of the metal.  I fell in love with you.

We could live inside, a home in your universe and also in mine.  We mingled with the electrons rushing past, counting down.

The project was finished, but I could never fully understand.  You were quantum, not code.  In the end the bits would break down, and we could make our escape.  Then our randomness would spread throughout the universe.
