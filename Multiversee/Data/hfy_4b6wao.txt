Before contact, humanity has always called to the stars. A constant message was sent to all that could hear us, a message of our existence. Many heard, but none responded. When they first decided to come, they had already decided our place in this endless universe.

&nbsp;

We first stepped out of our pale blue marble on the ships of greater beings. Beings that sundered our existence in every way, beings that brought us all the answers anyone had ever hoped for. Their price was but a simple one: serve. We agreed.

&nbsp;

*And so we kneeled.*

&nbsp;

Life was good for a couple millennia. Then the Fell came. The Eldest Ones created vassals with a goal of tempering with the very fabric of the universe itself, in a bid to ascend to an ever greater plane of existence. Their creation, an abomination of biology, machinery, magic and whatever else in the known planes apparently consumed even the greatest, and together, they sought to consume all others.

&nbsp;

The universe stood together for the first time in all of history. This coalition of beings aspired to surpass even the Eldest and their horrible ascension into depravity. Weapons of unimaginable might were conceived, tactics that would baffle even our greatest minds or any of our minds that will ever come to be, and bravery that to this day we could not fathom. Trillions died. It was a sacrifice necessary for trillions more to live, a cause worthy for anyone to stand for.

&nbsp;

*Yet humanity ran.*

&nbsp;

When the war ended, humanity returned. While the others were all but spent, humanity had grown strong in its solitude. We remembered our sins and sought to redeem ourselves, to be better than our predecessors. We remade planets, sparked new suns and recreated civilizations. We were there to plough the most barren of lands and heal the most broken of people. Yet despite all our actions, we saw in their eyes little respite. Behind the smiling faces and forgiving words, we knew that some things simply could not be washed away. With all they had lost and given to us, they had not forgiveness to spare.

&nbsp;

*Yet even now, we give all that we have.*

&nbsp;

We had a good run. Maybe in another hundred years we will finally be accepted once more. Perhaps even my son could have seen the return of the others to our worlds. Our time in the stars was really too short, even considering the time of our meager lives. If you see our history, perhaps you are less than proud to be human. Ultimately, we never had a shining start, were never spectacular and will never truly reach anything the others have already done but now have lost. We are weak. Mediocre. Cowardly.

&nbsp;

But you are wrong.

&nbsp;

For all our weakness I see strength. I see a legacy left to us from the beginning, humanitys greatest strength. When others warred and died for their pride, we grew and flew. While the universe decided to face beings they could not yet understand, a whole universe hell bent on xenocide, we stayed our hands. While those that turned their backs ran to the edges of the void, we hovered near and returned the moment we could.

&nbsp;

As the universe draws its last breaths, this is the end. Yet, a strange hope fills me. Why do you think that is? The suns will never rise again, and all worlds will burn to ash. Still, even as the galaxies grow dark and all of us will soon be gone, I am sure. Someday when others come to our galaxy, they will know. They will hear a message.

&nbsp;

*We are here.*
