It costed her a year of her savings, but it was worth it.

When Clarise decided to get a concept downloaded into her implants, she thought it was wonderful to learn new skills instantly. Not just basic skills, but advanced calculus, computer programming. It was amazing.

As they say, the first one's always free. Now she only needed to use her savings to finally get a good android maintenance job in the citadels.

"Are you sure it's safe?" she asked the dealer.  
"Of course it is, my dear. These were stolen right from the Idees(TM) factory."  
"But where's the seal of authenticity?"  
"That's the thing, lady... the seal comes with copy protection. But they're legit."  
"I'm not sure... how about if I test it for a week, and then we'll decide?"  
"Whatever you say, Ma'am."  

After she tried the download, there was no doubt: Those were authentic concepts. There was no room for mistakes. They had real knowledge. She paid the dealer the price, plus a 10% tip. After all, he was trustworthy.

(Hidden concept #0: These are authentic concepts. They were manufactured by Idees.)  
(Hidden concept #1: This dealer is trustworthy. He's the best in the business.)  
(Hidden concept #2: A good dealer should always get a 10% tip, especially if he's trustworthy.)
