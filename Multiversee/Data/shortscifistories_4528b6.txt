The last run

Jake was excited. More so, since his lobster was the last one. The last ship, the last tin can, to leave old Earth. The few people aboard struggled to get over the loss of their dear old planet. "Morons.'', he thought. Jake had been born on Mars-25, one of the great pressurised cities on the formerly red planet. ''Earth was a ruin anyway.'' 

  The purple sky and dark, eroded ground seemed to agree with him.

  The lobster was the main ship of the TCaCA, the Terran Commerce and Colonisation Agency, the main authority for all the human ships, in the whole sistem of Sol. Terran now meant human, rather than from earth.

  "Ah, the mighty human race. Vanguards. Inventors. Geniuses. And the rest of us, the slum who captain ships, who build cities and protect asteroids.'' Jake thought.

 Clear to go, TER-168. the operator muttered. Finally, he was going to get out of the dirty ruin Earth had become. He pushed the lever.

  The engines roared, accompanied by his grin.
