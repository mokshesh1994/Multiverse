***********************************************

&nbsp;

Well, this sure sucks big ones.

&nbsp;

God damn intel frackers, Oh, the LZ is cold, theres no way theyll see you coming! Slip in, prepare the drop zones, its a milk run! Yeah, a dozen batteries of anti-orbital plasma cannon is definitely a cold LZ. Tell that to the rest of the squad!

&nbsp;

Okay, someones gotta save the invasion from the idiots in intel. Since Im all thats left, I guess its gonna be me. Better get a beer out of this.

&nbsp;

Lizards are going to be looking for survivors soon. At least one of those blasts was meant for me. Thanks for getting in its way, Buckley. Im really sorry for that business in New Topria. You were asking for it, but damn if Im not sorry. Now, if the lizards will be looking for me, question is where to go? Got to find a transmitter. The subspace link in the Lieutenant's pod is gone. And I dont have any reading from the secondary in the supply crate. Probably got nailed, too. But the briefer mentioned a cache in the mountains to the west. Should have a link and transmitter. And if it doesnt, Im gonna find him and send his ass on a hot drop without a pod.

&nbsp;

Checking for carrier No signal. But that makes sense. Mountains will block the signal, and its probably in low power mode, anyway. Going to have to get close. Thats a fifty kilometer hike. And two days before fleet gets here. Fifty kilometers. Forty-eight hours. With a bunch of reptilian frackers hunting for me. What god did I piss off to draw this short straw?

&nbsp;

Dont need all this gear. Emergency rations, medkit, some extra ammo, couple grenades, rifle... Pathfinding gear stays here. Ditto heavy weapons. Damn I wish I could keep the plasma rifle, but its a heavy mother. Dont need the spare uniform, but Ill take the socks. Wont be doing any sleeping, so bedroll is out, too. Okay, now set the proximity self-destruct. Thatll give em a nasty little surprise. Set it on a delay, too. Might be able to get more than the point man. Lizard. Whatever.

&nbsp;

Time to get the frack out of here. Mountains are that way. Alright, just a walk in the park. A park with purple trees. And lizards that want to kill me.

Fracking great.

&nbsp;

****************************************

&nbsp;

Hour thirty of my little walk in the park. Frack, I just might make it. Ten kilometers to go. Done a ten kay in two hours before. But the patrols are making it a bitch and a half. At least the stims are working. Those things ar *good*! Wish the implant would let me use em outside combat. Can think of a few times when being able to stay alert for forty hours would be nice. But, nooooooooo. That would be a misuse of government property. An extra maintenance load. Potentially addictive. Bastards.

&nbsp;

Hungry, though. Just about time to break out another ration pack. Right about now, I could probably stomach the corned beef an-

&nbsp;

Shit. Lizard. Thirty meters. Damn purple trees. Just appeared out of nowhere. Did he see- Frack, he saw me!

&nbsp;

**PSHHHHHHT**

&nbsp;

Too slow, asshole. Hopefully his friends couldnt hear a low velocity grav pellet. Come on come on Damn, thats a lot of hissing. Theyve found the body. Okay, see them now. Looks like ten of them. Nine now. Covers blown, need to get through before they pin me down. Lets see, that one looks like a leader. Breathe. Fire. Switch targets. That one has a support weapon. Breathe. Fire. Next.

&nbsp;

Its like theyre moving through syrup. Why- Oh, implants active. Must have sensed the adrenaline dump. Only thing better than stims is combat drugs. All of that pseudo-epinephrine and glucose and oxygenation goop is amazing. Oh, another one. Breathe. Fire.

&nbsp;

Looks like they have my position. But I have theirs. Six left. Five. Three. One. And down. Okay, cut the combat drugs. Ugh, hate that. Feels like everythings moving too fast. But cant overuse it. Burn my brain.

&nbsp;

Speaking of burns. Mother frackers got me! Damn creepy. Left forearms black from a laser burn or plasma bloom, but dont feel a damn thing. Hooray adrenaline!  Hooray magic painkillers! But cant leave a third degree burn exposed. Bit of biofoam to disinfect and accelerate healing. And a patch of artificial skin to seal it. Great, now that Im not leaving bits of myself behind, its running time. Covers blown, caution meet wind.

&nbsp;

Still a long way to go, but might still get there. Got to try. Depends if this group got a message off and how often they check in. Either way, gonna need another shot of stims for this. Ahhhh. Thats the stuff.

&nbsp;

****************************************

&nbsp;

Sounds like they know Im in the area. Heard a few transports. Hell, some of them must have been gunships, too. Glad this uniform comes standard with sensor jammers or one of them would have blasted me into little bloody bits. But Im leaving a trail a blind man could find and they have to be following it. Pretty sure thats whats kicking up those bird clouds in the distance. Cant be more than a kilometer back. But that leaves me here.

&nbsp;

I knew I was getting higher, but I cant believe I hit the treeline. Ill be wide open out there. One of the frackers steps out of the trees and its game over, man! But maps say the cache is on the other side of this ridge, and if I get over before they see me Ill be home free! So I just have to run really, really fast. Damn it, I did not sign up for this.

&nbsp;

Left, right, left, right. Watch the hole. Would suck to trip here. Worst sprained ankle of all time. Okay, this bush was just about half way. Not much further. Maybe I should have been a cross country sprinter? Probably breaking a record here. Just another hundred meters and-

&nbsp;

Im falling? What the frack? I didnt trip. Oh damn. Thats a lot of blood. And muscle. Oh. Sniper. That cruel scally little fracker getting my hopes up. Well, I see you now. Standing up? What an amature. Breath. Fire. Try hitting me with half of your lungs splattered across the mountain. And next time dont aim for the legs.

&nbsp;

Alright, can I move? I think damn. Felt that. Hmmm. I guess painkillers cant get around half my thigh missing. But I can stand. And hobble. Okay, need to make it about eighty meters. Just eighty meters and Im over the top and I might make it. Little further. Little-

&nbsp;

Note to self: throwing oneself onto a bed of hard, pointy granite is generally disrecommended. Even if it to get out of view of a bunch of bloodthirsty reptilian aliens. But are they yep, theyre just coming out of the trees. Thank you, sixth sense. Still leaves the problem of that last thirty meters. Theyll see me if I move. Theyll find me if I wait. And theyll kill me if I fight.

&nbsp;

But at least I might take a few with me.

&nbsp;

Lets see, drop the ruck. Wont need it. Rifle is fully loaded. Set velocity to max. No point in quiet and might need the stopping power. Magnification to mid range, zero at three hundred meters, eight kilometer per hour wind from the north. Now wait for them all to get well out into the open. Thats right, come out where I can see you. Forty of you. Full platoon. Alright, wait until theyre at least a hundred meters from the woodline. Good. Now which is the leader? That ones staying further back than the rest. Coward? No, he looks like hes talking to something. Definitely a leader. Okay, that ones first. As soon as he passes that rock. Wait. Wait. There. Hes down.

&nbsp;

Shit, frack, and damn there are a lot of these lizards. Do they grow on trees or something? No, wrong color. They arent purple enough. And thats seven and I think yeah, they know where I am. What I wouldnt give for my plasma rifle. Or backup. Or a saturation bombardment from an orbital battleship with all the trimmings. Yeah, thats the stuff. And that makes an even dozen. Damn, theyre pouring on a lot of fire. Youd almost think they were upset about something. Cant imagine what.

&nbsp;

**Thwack**

&nbsp;

Oh. *Oh.* Frackity frack frack *frack*! Must have been a ricochet or a fragment because if that had been a full slug my lungs would be gone. But its bad enough. Sucking chest wound is natures way of telling you to slow down and all. Still dont feel a thing; thank you drugs, you wonderful chemicals you!

&nbsp;

Huh, theyve stopped firing. Oh, yeah. Probably because I stopped. Think Im dead or something. Well, yeah, I am. But not yet. Still, soon as I pop my head out its gone. Unless... Lets see, how do I do this again? Blah blah blah safety warning. Yadda Yadda Yadda permanent injury. Oh, high probability of fatal side effects? And you think I care right now because? Yeah, thats right. You had better shut your digital trap. And here. We. Go.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Wow. This is wow. Everythings so slow. And detailed. Never dumped the implants entire combat drug reservoir before. Its odd. Well, time to see if more really is better.

&nbsp;

Hey, at least I can walk again! Lizards dont seem to be moving that fast, though. Either someone sprayed them with super glue or this time dilation thing gets stronger with dosage. Im going with option two, but if someone really did douse their scaly hides with glue I wont complain. Hope it burns like hell. Step, shoot, step, shoot. Hey, Lizards, dead man walking, here! Try and get me!

&nbsp;

Theyre moving now. Still slow. Really slow. Couple of shots, still going after my old hidy hole. Am I really moving that fast? No clue. More down. Gotten at least half. Lost count, and I think a couple of those might just be good at ducking. Speaking of ducking, maybe I should do some? Pretty sure one of the bastards just burned my gut with a laser or something. Yep, armor stopped most of it, not all. But who needs a liver, anyway?

&nbsp;

Whats that flashing light? Implant Notification: Beacon link established. Send message? Uh, yes. Hell the frack yes! Damn, must have moved just in range. Uh, implant, dump logs to beacon for immediate transmission to fleet. Execute.

&nbsp;

Alright, back to business. Why am I on my knees. Oh, knee. Left legs gone. And I was using that, too. Well, have some of this. Yeah, take my leg, I take your head. And you. And you. Missed? How did I miss that? Whats wrong with me? Oh, yeah.

&nbsp;

Beeping? Is that blood loss? Pretty sure the haze is from the blood loss, but never heard of it causing beeping. Maybe combat drug overdose? Nah, thats the pounding heart. Probably why I cant think straight, either. And why did I stop shooting again? I really should be doing that thing. Oh, beeping is low ammunition warning. One shot left. Real shame to die with one bullet. Joke in that, somewhere. But cant see anything to put it in. Cant see all that much, anyway.

&nbsp;

Oh, theres one. Shooting at me, too. Terrible shot, couldnt hit the broadside of a barn. And breathe. Huh, cant breathe. Well, skip that and shoot. Got em. But maybe he wasnt such a bad shot after all. Doesnt matter. Rifles empty, so an arms not all that important.

&nbsp;

Really is pretty out here. Clear sky, beautiful mountains, even the purple trees are nice. Were they always purple? Cant remember. Damn flashing lights. What are those words? Sync Complete? What does that mean? Something important, I think. Something I was supposed to do? Or did? Hard to concentrate. Hopefully it means something good No sergeant not sleeping... just resting my eyes

&nbsp;

*Usual post story comments. Sorry for the feels. Well, no, Im not. I was aiming for feels. This story actually came to me when I heard three words: Dead Man Walking. Heard them before, but had the biotech prompt in my mind and wondered what would happen if a human got into a situation they knew they werent going to get out of, but had something that could keep them going at full until their body literally gave out. So a few hours of fleshing out the details and a few more of writing and this came along. Im pretty happy with it, if I do say so myself. One of the best I feel Ive written. But Ill let you all be the judge of that*

&nbsp;

*For those wondering why I havent been posting anything recently, Im actually working on a very large project. Going to be months more until I post it, but if the outline holds it will be about 80k words for the first arc. I have around 20k written, but my job is hectic and I dont have a ton of time to devote to writing. Might get it out by late summer if Im lucky. Well see.*
