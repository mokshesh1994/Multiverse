Infinite Infinities

"The multiverse is strange, isn't it."

"Strange is relative, Richard. Should we activate the machine?"

"I'm not sure. Opening the door to infinity just doesn't sound like a good idea."

"We're not 'opening the door' per say, just exposing our universe to the infinite number of other universes out there. We're more... blending the seams, a bit."

"I've been thinking. Literally everything is out there, right? What if there is a creature, capable of crossing between universes, who loves eating men named Richard? I'd be dead the second you turned the machine on."

"But then there exists a creature whose sole purpose in life is eating that creature, right? I mean, just by the nature of infinity alone."

"Yeah I guess."

"So we'll activate it then?"

"One second, Alan. So what if there is a multidimensional creature, you know a hundred tentacles or whatever, somewhere out there who's processes of natural selection and influence have moved it to a life of turning off devices that expose isolated universes to the multiverse?"

"Don't be stupid, Richard."

"That creature would exist somewhere, right? An infinite number of infinite possibilities. It'd be impossible if it didn't exist."

"That's just ridiculous. Let's just turn this thing on, I want to start my research. Are you ready or not?"

"I'm not sure."

"Okay Richard, here we go. Three... two... one..."

"I'm not sure about this, Alan."

"I've flipped the initial fabric distorter... power is now coming over from the batteries... 

Oh!"

"What is it, Alan?"

"Powers dead. Someone flipped the switch back."

"Wasn't me."

"I know it wasn't."

"Who was it?"

"That creature you were talking about, Richard, the one with one hundred tentacles. Only it was more like pincers. Like big hairy pincers. Maybe we'd better not."
