PAL, Ive killed myself, havent I?

*You failed to implement Module 12s lock-out, tag-out procedure, Dr. Winn.*

I know that, PAL. But thats not what I asked. Have I killed myself?

*Do you have a means of propulsion? A compressed air cylinder or something of the like? Crew members of Module 12 are mandated to carry a personal propulsion device at all times when working in the construction hanger to mitigate the danger of lock-out, tag-out procedures failing during zero-G transportation.*

I was in a hurry, PAL. My PPD is back in the crew quarters. I saw the emergency beacon and rushed out here. I thought I gave myself enough of a push to cover the 50 yards or so to the control panel.

*A ladder was available, Dr. Winn.*

I know that, PAL. I said I was in a hurry.

*The beacon was a false alarm. Module 12 is structurally intact and en-route to Europa.*

Good to know, PAL. PAL, Im only about 10 feet from the wall. If you can think of a way to give me just a little push, I can crawl back to the door.

*Im sorry, Dr. Winn. The life support systems here are passive; there are no fans in the construction hanger to avoid damaging sensitive electronic components with statically charged air currents.*

Can you wake any of the other crew members?

*Im sorry, Dr. Winn. Your appointed shift as module monitor isnt up for another two months. Waking another crew member in the middle of a deep cryo-cycle could cause mild-to-moderate brain damage. The cycle has to complete its course.*

So Ill hang here in mid-air, 10 feet from the wall, for the next two months? Thats what youre telling me, PAL?

*Youll die of dehydration long before that, Dr. Winn.*

What would I do without you, PAL?

*I dont understand the question.*

I know, PAL. Tell me this - can you open the hangar view portals?

*I can, Dr. Winn. Opening the portals now.*

Thank you, PAL. Tell me - in all that endless black - which speck is Europa?

*Its not visible from your current position, Dr. Winn. Were you able to orient yourself with your head facing the far-side bay door, youd see Europa as a small fleck. As it is, the applicable portal is directly behind your left ear.*

I imagine I could see a lot of things if I wasnt dangling in empty space, PAL.

*Do you want me to describe what you can see?*

Yes PAL - put the description on loop forhow long do you think I have?

*Likely not more than three or four days, Dr. Winn.*

Put it on loop for 120 hours, PAL. Maximum volume. Its too quiet in here to die well.

*As you wish, Dr. Winn. Beginning 120 hours of star map narration now.*

Goodbye, PAL.

*Good night, Dr. Winn.*
