This is part two of The Age of Man, my little story for here. I hope I was able to make it a bit longer for you guys, and I hope you enjoy!
***

The Keep of Redwater stood in shambles. Outside, thousands of High Elven soldiers stood, ready for one last charge. They were conscripts, not fully trained, but a formidable army none the less. The Dominion of the High Elves was known for its value placed on Quantity, not Quality. Each elf had nothing more than a spear and shield, maybe some leather armor or, if their family was richer, a chainmail hauberk. Siege engines, once loud and thunderous in their efforts, stood silent, their crews waiting a safe distance away from the main gate. Behind this enormous force rode Lord Galahad, commander and Lord Protector of the Western March. Clothed in steel, brushed until it shone in the weak morning light, he smiled, looking down at the castle below.

Once a mighty and proud citadel, with constant bombardment and fantastical magics being thrown at it for months, wear had begun to show. The eastern wall was nothing more than rubble and bodies, having been the focus point of an attack last week. As neither side had wanted to take the risk of collecting the slain, they had been left to rot, attracting carrion crows.Young Lord Galahad wrinkled his nose in disgust. He enjoyed war, but one fought from a distance, or better yet, on paper. The reddish sand, the keeps namesake, continually got everywhere, and was almost impossible to get out of his riding boots. He would be glad once this castle fell, and the Thrice Damned Regnum with it. 

The Dominion battlemages kept their distance from the Lord Protector. They knew he currently was in a good mood, but was prone to change at almost any possible second. The cold and early morning awakening he had received did not help, and anything could and would send him over the edge. Therefore, none of them bothered to notify him of the strange chill creeping into the air, and the unexplainable mist that rose up from the shoreline.

***

A note on Human magics and history: Humans were made by the minor god of stone, who felt jilted after his brother, the god of metals, had made the dwarves. However, this minor god of stone had been killed in the War Inside Heaven, leaving mankind without a patron. Therefore, mankind had taken to worshiping certain Older Gods, older even than the god of Time. These Old Ones were dead, slain by the Nothing countless millennia ago, but their power remained. Their language of runes and arcane symbols were known by only a few men, and guarded as jealous secrets. Use of these runes would gift a druid of The Old Ones a tiny fraction of an iota of their power, the power of creation, the power used to shape the universe. These druids were given the gift of reshaping or summoning beasts from the beginning of the world, and the use of some tiny bit of creation magics, should the Old Ones language be read aloud. 

Therefore, when the mist arrived, it was no ordinary mist, as it was called by priests of Men, the priests of the Old Ones. It was the mists of creation, from the beginning of times, and in it lurked monsters beyond comprehension.

***
Battlemage Ellis looked around nervously, wondering where that damned mist came from, and why it came so suddenly. As far as he knew, there were no Weather Mages hiding away in the Keep, as they would have come out to do battle with him much earlier on in the siege. Therefore, he had a sneaking suspicion that reinforcements were arriving, and that they would not be friendly. He was almost completely sure that inside Redwater Keep were the only enemy soldiers for miles around, but again, he was only almost sure. He coughed into his hand, trying to work up the courage to tell his lord, when something was heard from the mist.

A deep, loud, and mystical thrum of Rams Horns came out of the misted air, carrying with it a horrible primordial fear. Shadows arrived on the shoreline, like monsters out of some storybook tale. Dominion infantry were whispering and turning to view this spectacle, and Lord Galahad himself felt a tiny shiver of fear run down his spine. The mists seemed to split apart, and a creature walked forth.

It wore a long, flowing fur cloak, and horned helm that covered its face, leaving only two black pits where the eyes should have been. Runes, glowing with the light of an ancient sun from a land before time began, covered the creatures helm and blade. The sword it wielded was dark and huge, like the creature itself, but seemed to be held with relative ease.

The creature stepped forward again, nothing but silence coming from the fell warrior. The sword was raised, and from the mist came hundreds like it, but none quite as big or intimidating. The army of Man had arrived, and was ready for war.

***

Jarl Harlaus smiled beneath his warhelm, enjoying the sight of Elven fear. He let himself take one last breath of air, before letting the Blood Rage overtake him, and charging forward.

The lines of spearmen had been hastily drawn up,  and the army of conscripts was completely unprepared for the berserking man who slammed into their lines, like a hammer striking steel. The impact from Harlaus body alone threw the line backwards, as he swung his sword with the strength of many men, crushing bones and shields alike. With long sweeping blows, the Jarl launched himself through the men, wading through spear thrusts like water. Blood spattered onto his fearsome armor as Elf after Elf was crushed beneath his might. The runes that covered his armor and weapons seemed to glow brighter after every death, till the berserking lord was shining like his own star, in the field of dead bodies that was accumulating quickly around him.

Each man of Harlaus company fought with an equal fervor, though none of them matched their Jarl. Like a whirlwind of death and destruction, the huscarls of the Lonely Isles ripped apart the hastily assembled Elven line, crushing them beneath their might. The Black Raven Banner flew high that day, behind the backs of Men.

***

Battlemage Ellis looked on in horror as the grand army of Lord Galahad was ripped apart, the stench of death reaching him already. He gestured to his fellow mages, as they raised their hands to perform the arcane, and hopefully restore balance to this battle. Lord Galahad himself was beside himself in fury, lashing out at his subordinates and  screaming in anger. He turned his warlike gaze onto Ellis, who, sweating in fear, redoubled his magical efforts.

Bolts of fire began to rain down from the sky, and the unstoppable tide slowed. Men and Elf alike were incinerated as the sticky substance appeared across the battlefield, burning the ground around it, and cutting through the mist. Monstrous Golems made of mud and dirt rose up from the ground, and waded into the fray, throwing their enemies to the skies, or dragging them into the earth itself. The gods of Death enjoyed that day, drinking greedily from the overflowing goblet of suffering.

The horde of Men was halted, however briefly. The Battlemages, pride of the Dominion, had succeeded in their duty, and Ellis let out a sigh of relief as their work plowed into the human army, wreaking havoc. 

***

Jarl Harlaus, eyes red from the Blood Rage, looked up to see the sky blazing with fire, and unholy abominations rising out of the dirt itself. He saw his men die, huscarls and freemen who had pledged their lives to him, being slain one by one. This would not stand. An inhuman howl of rage and anger was ripped from his chest, and he threw himself on the poor quaking Elves in his way. Simply running through them, his broad shoulders, berserk body, and Runed armor tossing them aside as one would children. He kept  his eyes focused on his new, worthy enemy, a Battlemage clothed in white, his hands held aloft, causing the destruction of his forces. A Golem blocked his way, obviously intending to stop him before he got to far. Harlaus jumped forward, a second scream coming from his body, as he slammed into the Golem. A bright flash of the ancient Runes adorning his sword, a flexing of muscles, and a Golem fell into the earth, dirt returning to dirt. Harlaus continued onwards, panting in anticipation.

His bodyguard of loyal huscarls followed closely, trying their best to keep up. They were all fearsome warriors in their own right, but they paled in comparison to their Jarl. Swords, axes and spears all twisting in the deadly dance of death, the group went on, killing everything in their path. The standard bearer, holding the banner of the Raven aloft, took his place in the middle of the group, flying his flag proudly, roaring in his rage.

***

Elf bodies and Golem constructs fell beneath the rage of the dark creature, as Battlemage Ellis simply sat there, not wanting to believe what his eyes were telling him. He saw as the dark creature, this monsterous warlord, this..human broke through his defensive line. He saw as this man ran towards him. He saw the man shrug off firebolt after firebolt, spear after spear, wounds only seeming to make him more enraged. He saw this Avatar of Death scream in rage, raising his sword. Battlemage Ellis then saw no more.

***

Lord Galahad could only watch as his forces were turned into a feast for crows, the pride of the High Elven Dominion being torn to shreds. He turned to signal the retreat to his mages, when a deep feeling of despair reverberated through his body. The mages all lay slain, and their killer stalked over to him. Blood covering every inch of its body, horns dripping with gore, and sword drenched in death, the thing approached him, like something out of a horrible nightmare. He barely felt it as its hand closed around his throat, throwing him from his horse, and lifting him into the sky. The remnants of the High Elven forces turn at their leaders cries and sobs, held aloft over the battlefield. The monster reached its hands up as Galahad let out another cry for mercy, gripping his open jaw. With a disgustingly wet rip, the jaw was removed, and the former proud lord was thrown headfirst into ground, the remains of his head splitting open upon impact. The Elven army had lost its will to fight after that, as well as its bowels.


***

Jarl Harlaus looked on as his men rounded up the last bit of the High Elven army, Blood Rage slowly flowing out of his veins. Hearing a loud creak, he turned, to see the almost forgotten gates of Redwater Keep open up. Out rode a Wood Elf, wearing a green robe, and woven antlers as a crown. Harlaus laughed to himself, only now remembering why he had come there in the first place. Each step towards his ally shook off more blood and gore from the Jarls armor, and the poor King looked pale in shock.

Well, I must say, I will never again doubt the fearsomeness of your army, brave Jarl. While I disprove of the Here the Elf King paused, wrinkling his nose in disgust. Brutality your men seem so prone too, I cannot argue with results. Come inside, and we can discuss payment for your help and the exact conditions of our alliance somewhere where dead bodies dont cover the ground

Jarl Harlaus nodded. Aye, sounds good to me. Hakkon! Direct the men! This fancy Elven tart and I have to talk all diplomatic like The Jarl rolled his eyes dramatically to make a point, as his huscarl nodded in acknowledgement. 

The Man and Wood Elf walked inside, and the Siege of Redwater was over.
