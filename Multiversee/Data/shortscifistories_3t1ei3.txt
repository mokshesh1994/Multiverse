Disconnect
frankz0509
In a way, we are all just drones. Our physical brains are just extremely complex transceivers, capable of processing, sending, and receiving information to and from the Mind. Yes, Mind. As in capital M. We all share the Mind. Ever wonder why sometimes you feel like you've already seen a place when it's actually your first time there? Or a certain person or situation feels vaguely familiar, yet this is certainly the first time? Scientists and psychologists call it *deja vu*. It's supposedly your brain receiving a nerve impulse twice.

Or you know, you *actually* have been there and done that -- only in a different body. But we're not supposed to remember our memories from there.

What happens when we die? The Hindu believe we get reincarnated. We don't. Something that was never alive can never die. The Mind has been there before "time" and forever will be.

Sometimes, we phase out of our designated bodies and instead enter someone else's. Ever dreamt of people or places you swear you've never seen before? There you go.

People sharing LSS without ever humming or speaking about it beforehand? You knowing exactly what your friend is about to say, right before they say it? That's the Mind at work for you.

I tried to disconnect. I failed.

Now I watch in the crowd as my family and friends mourn the lifeless body I shed inside an oakwood coffin. Do I tell them that is this me? Will they believe me?
