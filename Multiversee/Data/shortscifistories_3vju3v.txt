Personality defect

Dr. Mallard walked in and greeted Mary warmly.  He had been preparing for several minutes in his office and eventually became satisfied with what he would say.  Dr. Mallard, in a way, had to convince the young widow to give up some of the memories of her husband.

The Enhanced Human Mind Mapping Project (EHMMP), completed several years ago, had already begun to heavily influence many aspects of life.  Screening for mental disorders and more sophisticated job placement agencies were but two of many examples.  The Mapping Project's complementary technology, Synaptic Reconfiguration and Refinement (SRR), was now being used to repair damage from strokes and to resocialize criminals.

If applied early enough to a fetus, however, SRR could even change the course of development of the incipient neural circuits.  Their brains could be programmed with the personalities and other mental qualities of their parents, far more precisely than from the crude influences of simple genetics.  Although "enhancements" geared towards fostering a greater intellect and preventing mental illness were very strongly encouraged and had always been used in the past, they did carry over and change the personality and other traits in subtle ways.  It even became useful to measure the enhancement in terms of the "personality defect" it produced.

"Good morning Mrs. Carlson," Mallard said as he took a seat on the stool.

"Good morning Dr. Mallard." Mary smiled but looked apprehensive.  No doubt she had read about the recommendations.

"I hope that you're well."  He knew how devastating her husband's car crash had been.

"Yes I am, thank you."

"Have you been able to read over the information packet we talked about last time?"

"I have."  Mallard prepared himself for the lengthy discussion that would likely ensue.

"Do you have any questions?"

"No."  Mallard knew where this was going.  They had talked extensively during her 16 week prenatal visit about the decision they would have to make today at her 24 week visit.  His brain would begin to grow more rapidly, and whatever refinements were to be made would need to be done in the next two weeks.

"Have you decided on a name?"

"Daniel."  Mary fought to hold back the tears.  "It was his grandfather's."  Mallard offered her a tissue as he felt a genuine sense of sadness; his mother had passed from lung cancer 10 years ago, when treatments were still incredibly crude.

"What a beautiful name!"  Mallard sighed; he hated this part.  Most times it went smoothly, but frequently mothers raised objections.  Could he really blame them?  Mallard gave her a moment.  "Would you like a few moments?"  Mary stifled her tears for several seconds, then shook her head no.  "I'd like to know how you feel about the brain enhancements."

Mary looked at him calmly.  "I don't want any."  She wiped away another tear.  "And I don't care that I'd be the first mother to not use them.  Daniel is going to be from me and my husband, with nothing else."  Mallard sized up the situation, paused for a few moments, and proceeded cautiously.

"I'd like to help."

"That's all I want!"  Mary was starting to become indignant.  "We don't want any modifications, upgrades, or gimmicks!"  Mallard leaned back and rubbed the bridge of his nose.  He knew that Mary wanted Daniel to hold some of his father's memories, or brain characteristics.  Like many individuals trying to conceive these days, Mary and her late husband had undergone formal mapping to be used during their pregnancies.  In a way, her husband's map was the most concrete memory of his that Mary had left.

Dr. Mallard felt a sense of caring, fear and exhilaration as he loaded the maps.  His physician group would almost certainly let him go and he would face an investigation, as even though the enhancements were not mandated yet, they were universally encouraged and had always been used.  The system hummed along, trying to combine the circuits in the maps in the most sensible way.  How would Mary's creativity work out with Daniel's humor?

In several minutes a notification window appeared, along with a lengthy and complicated form for specifying enhancements and modifications.  Mary had filled out the exception form, but Mallard would still be lambasted.  He clicked on a tiny, seemingly grayed-out icon near the bottom right corner.  A warning message appeared, reminding him that choosing not to implement the basic recommended neural enhancements would require notification of the state and federal governments.  Mallard hesitated, but ultimately clicked through.

As Mary entered the SRR transducer (which was similar to a conventional MRI machine), Mallard loaded the composite map, completely unmodified.  He was placed on administrative leave the next day, and let go one week later.

Dr. Mallard leaned back in his chair as he pondered the radical changes which the fields of neuroscience and "neuro-engineering"  had undergone over the past twenty-five years.  He picked up the picture of Daniel, nestled between the pictures of his own family, and marveled at the wonder.  People used to think that pheromones helped to influence selection of a partner, but there had been so much more.  Intricate, exceptionally complex arrangements of neural circuits had tried to work with each other by helping to guide the selection process.  Of course the circuits would be combined in the offspring in very crude ways, as they had to be specified through very simple genetics.

Who would have thought that combining the circuits directly, without modification, would allow them to work together so well?  Mallard took another look at Daniel.  He was a prodigy in every possible way, and even though the Nobel Committee would never award a prize to someone so young, it was arguably long overdue.  But he was also a brilliant tactician and a truly inspiring leader, very likely turning the tides of war and saving immense casualties.  Then again, his circuits had been affected by a bit of bravery as well.
