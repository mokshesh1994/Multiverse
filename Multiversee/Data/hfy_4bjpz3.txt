[OC] Paradox.

&nbsp;

This is what we are.

&nbsp;

In our youth, when we lived on a crowded planet, we called it a paradox.

&nbsp;

As we expanded through our system, we called it strange.

&nbsp;

While colonizing new systems we jested, and called it the Human Condition.

&nbsp;

When our race filled the galaxy, we called it possible.

&nbsp;

When we filled the Universe, we called it Truth.

&nbsp;

And now, staring headlong at the End, we call it a challenge.

This was my first try at one of these, so I'm sure something very similar has been done before. Just be gentle....
