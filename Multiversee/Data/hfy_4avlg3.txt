Yes, humans were many things. Their average lifespan was about thirty one years at this current age and if it wasnt for many things like automated food production or ease of construction, much of society would have fallen apart by now in complete anarchy as the average age of the human citizen ranged at about fifteen years old. It was in this time that couples were encouraged to have many children in order to offset the great war that had taken the lives of countless families, friends, neighbors and coworkers. 

That was the lingering fact that remained within the minds of President Yuan Shen and Vice President Alexander Grey while they waited within inside the large conference room that hosted the leaders of Earth. Seated besides the President and Vice President was Ambassador Jillian Argo and Fleet Admiral Richard Pike. Aside from the guards which had been posted around the room, there was no other living creature present. 

To be honest, President Shen had wanted this debate to be as public as possible. Unfortunately, given that the possibility of discussion of military strategy, this had to be kept as quiet as possible. Whether or not tensions would continue to rise, was just about anyone's guess. The Erians had been rather... blunt... with their recent diplomatic attempts. 

So, we received yet *another* message from the Erion homeworld, and I bet all of you can guess exactly what it is. 

Another *strongly worded* request that we do not pull out from the coalition, even though we already did? Admiral Pike asked with an impatient tap of his fingers. 

Right on. President Shen remarked dryly. I think theyre forgetting that were both the reason that the Horde didnt just skin them all alive, and were also the reason that Vahlis didnt just decide to open a black hole right in their skulls. Now, I respect the decision and all Jilian, but I think it may have been better if we just let the old man do his thing. 

Jill said nothing, only maintained a sulking silence. 

Now then, so we got a problem with the Erians. The good news is that they actually havent been on the good side of many coalition races. Story is, more of them are opting to pull out. Chances are theyre going to send another strongly worded 

There was a sudden and unexplained pause as Shens mouth suddenly stopped wide-open, as though she was still silently breathing words through her paused mouth. It wasnt just Shen that was frozen, but the entire room. Everything was silent, everything was still. Save for Richard and the manifestation of a familiar face. 

**Dear, dear. A perfect example of kittens that fancy themselves lions.** 

You! 

**Yes, we are here now, and we have been listening to this discussion. There are few times we allow ourselves to be impressed, but this certainly is one of those times. How old is your president? Your ambassador? You?**

You look down on us? 

**Look down? Boy, we are impressed for the most part. I see a collection of beings who wear the faces of children, but are already much greater than most creatures can hope in their entire lifetimes. Why do you think we come to you? You deserve our attention. Those around you? An indecisive politician? A spineless diplomat? And a obedient assistant? Much less so.** 


You got something against them? 

**Cowardice, indecision, blind obedience, weakness and lack of foresight. All of these are not traits that we must have during a moment of crisis. You remain worthy while our enemies remain with bloated egos and unwarranted confidence. You however, must not fall for their big words and little actions. You must act, and here we disclose our plan.** 

What plan? 

**Dont you think they owe you something? Something for three generations of lost humans? Perhaps two hundred and fifty systems, and one third of their GDP might just do fine.** 

I dont want another war. 

**With our help boy, this wont be a war. This will be punishment and retribution long due. Think of your parents, your parents parents. Think for a moment, had they not been victim to an Erian hoax, how they could still be here with you today. Think boy, and then decide, you think you are going to let those aliens get away with using your parents and grandparents as their shields? Now, tell them your idea. Go on.**

Message about how we agreed on their terms and all that jibberjabber. Shen continued as time miraculously unstopped. Just BS, BS and more BS. Everyone knows that theyre just puffed up buffoons who are just trying to act big. They need us more than we need them. 

And thats why we need to get our point across. Richard interjected as his lazily sitting position shifted upright. They need us more than we need them, why? Because were stronger than them. We only became their pawns because we fell for their charade. Not anymore. Look at their people. Most of them are even afraid to touch weapons, and here we are, and I see toddlers who can handle guns better than their most hardened veterans. Look at us. When have we **ever** needed them? What had they given to us that we couldnt have gotten? They took our fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers from us. We got scraps. They took something valuable, and its time they paid for it. 

What are you suggesting? Vice-President Grey asked as he adjusted his suit and began to look *very* interested. 

There are one-hundred and fifty systems that we fought for. We fought for, and the Erians live on them. Those systems should be ours. And for all the damage that the horde inflicted on us, damage that never would have even hurt us if the Erians didnt send the horde right into the middle of us, Id say a lot more folks would be alive. We should demand reparations. 

How much? Grey asked as he began to smile. Shen said nothing while Jillian descended into another level of frowning. 

Oh I dont know one third of the GDP for this year? 

One third eh? Make it one half. Madame president, you on board with this? 

Well, lets not get too hasty first. One hundred fifty systems? Thats about one quarter of all Erian territory. 

Territory they dont deserve. Richard remarked mirthlessly. And that GDP were demanding? One half is big, but its only a pittance to what they owe us. Besides, we could put the money to good use. There are still some systems that could use repairing, and a few new colonies we could develop. 

After a brief  and tentative agreement from Shen, it was Jill who asked the big question. 

What if they say no? Are you people forgetting that their military is about three times the size of ours?

She has a valid point you know. 

**You dont even believe that. We certainly dont. What advantage does a flock of sheep have against a lion? Look deep in yourself, and you know that there is no other possibility save for your victory. They will know that their military is larger, but are they even confident of their own chances at winning a war against you? It is not tribute you are really seeking at the end of the day, you are seeking to goad them into war. To bring upon them what they have wrought upon you.** 

So, what happens if they do accept our terms? 

**Will they? Will they be willing to lose dignity, wealth and territory all because you demanded it? Of course not. They will match your boast for one of their own. Then, that is when you will act. That is when you will strike terror and fear into those who have had justice waiting for a long time.**
