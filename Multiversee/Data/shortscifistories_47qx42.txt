Finally Sunset
Sebastian2203
I hear myself breathing, loud as if I am talking.

The sunset will rise soon, yet the silence comes to me even more violent as I hear my hearth rate increasing.

I check my clock... five more minutes.

Five more minutes and I am just getting started.

Soon everything will be gone, all of the possessions, my worries, grudges and everybody who judges.

The emotions itself will be gone as they are in my veins now, the pheromones, the hormones, all the cause of fear and anxiety.
The source of hate and love.

I wonder what will be life without them, will it be pure and clear or just vague and abstract, unable to form opinion because it lacks any instincts based on which it would judge..

All my answers might be answered soon..

I feel the poison creeping trough my veins, slowly my legs are numb as stone. 
I cant wait until I loose consciousness, I still hear my hearth rate increasing and blood pressure rising...

My body desperately trying to ward it off... yet it is futile.

Because as my vision turns black... I am awake.

I am awake and above my body, composed of nothing but light and energy, one with the universe and universe is one with me.
