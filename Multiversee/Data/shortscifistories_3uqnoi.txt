Technical writing
StanleyScience
The final subject of the day lost interest as the sound of knocking coils against concrete bled into the observation room.  Great, not one of his students had managed to understand past the first two pages.  Professor Richter sighed, massaged his face with his hands, and grudgingly paid another $40 participation fee for a complete failure.

What was it that was so hard to understand about technical writing?  Richter leaned back in his chair as he viewed the next-generation functional MRI recordings.  Everything started off fine, but really, who would get lost in the introductory paragraphs?  And from there things went downhill.  The small areas of cortex (the "technical" cortex he liked to call it) would heat up when his students tried harder to learn, then became extinguished when they gave up.  Richter was utterly confused, as he was absolutely sure that he wrote wonderfully.  No frills, no distractions, no humor, just the facts in a no-nonsense tome.  And yet their brains failed to grasp it.  Exasperated once more, he got ready for bed.  He had distilled all of his expertise into as concise a manner as possible, and yet he couldn't reach them.

Richter earnestly considered a sabbatical as he reviewed the latest test scores.  Had Facebook and Twitter turned their minds to mush?  With a genuine sense of dejection, he considered one option that he had promised himself never to entertain.  He would upload all of his knowledge into LearnIt!, the most advanced artificial intelligence-powered online learning platform, or so it claimed.  At least they paid a small sum up-front, and you did earn a small royalty for number of views.  And perhaps he could even reach a larger audience, some of whom would surely understand!  Richter's sense of excitement began to build.

He sank into utter frustration once more.  Why were there word limits?  Why could it not accept long blocks of what it referred to as "unformatted text"?  And then that cartoon "Clip" kept popping up, asking him to tag certain words or phrases with ideas or concepts and specify relationships between them.  Richter had felt genuine fury when Clip suggested adding a bit of humor or personal flair.

He finally lost it.  They wanted stupid writing?  Well fine!  With that Richter massacred his carefully-crafted prose into nuggets of diminutive sustenance.  He "tagged" and "linked", he threw his worst lame humor at it, he put his beautiful wall of text through a deli-slicer and spat each meaningless slice at some new text box.  They wanted "easy-to-understand"?  Then they could choke their feeble minds on the idiocy of it.

Richter could hardly believe it.  Not only had his content caught on through the internet, but his students (many of whom made use of LearnIt!, apparently) were engaging with his ideas.  Though the text might not have been as succinct, the relationship between ideas had been laid out much more explicitly, allowing them to be processed more efficiently.  He gladly paid out another $40 (a fraction of what he had earned) as he saw all the "non-technical" cortex lighting up as well.  Who would have imagined that could be so useful for learning?
