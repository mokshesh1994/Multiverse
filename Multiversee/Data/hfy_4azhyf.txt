Wings of Hope

Hey, this is kind of a small continuation of my story *'Sleepless Dream'*. I don't know if I should ask this but I would really appreciate some comments with constructive criticism and such. If some of you have read my other stories, you probably noticed that I tried to switch up my writing style a few times.  
     
Do you go into detail about everything or leave most to the imagination of the readers? I'm pretty new to this (especially writing in English) and really want to improve. Maybe my stories just aren't that interesting and I just don't know why.  
    
Anyway, thanks in advance.

There are balances to the universe, ones that Humanity doesn't share.    
On the 44th day of the 126th month of the XXth millennia the Conscious of Civilizations concluded that humanity didn't share the Balance of Mind. Hereby it was declared to be devoured by the tooth of time in isolation. No civilization was allowed near the cradle of Humanity. Any attempt to seek contact by the condemned was to be ignored and prevented.      
  
Only a single species objected.      
  
*"Don't force our hand."*  
T'hauer, Sequence of Thousands, stood from his place, his soundless words echoing loud in the council chamber. Hundreds of civilization proxies turned their attention towards him. This was unlike anything that had ever occurred in these void-like halls.  
*"Know your place, white one."*, a multitude of cold voices without source rushed back at him from all around, simply smothering the echo of his as they spoke, *"Your species was already punished not unlike them."*  
The two sets of nostrils on T'hauer's flat, mouthless face pulled slightly apart, he smirked. Unintimidated. *"And yet we are here."*  
The white ones didn't share the Balance of Mind, similar to Humanity. But they didn't need to. For theirs was the Balance of Strength - Military might beyond measure. More than enough to balance out other civilizations who rose to power through the same profession.  
With that an unpleasant realization creeped up on the Scales, those who forefathered the Conscious. 
*"You can't! YOU WILL NOT PROTECT THEM!"*, they roared, the voices bearing down on him like crushing waves on a rock.   
But just like that the white one stood tall, his semi-translucent skin flaring with rapidly moving dots of light.   
  
T'hauer lifted one of his black fingered hands gesturing and some of the council members shied in their places. He didn't hold anything and still by the reaction it could be inferred as aggression and threat.    
*"We can't protect them from the tooth of time. Our only intention is to uphold your verdict, oh Scales of Balance."*, he said, the echo of his minds voice pressuring against the unseen power in the space around him, lined with a tiny bit of defiance, *"We will make sure that Humanity is to remain isolated.   
However, anyone who interferes or encroaches on their home world sector before their time has expired will be extinguished."*  
His slender, clawed fingers pressed shut. The last word was a dagger amidst a cloak. Due to the very history of the white ones, to 'extinguish' something meant more than destruction, more than annihilation. It was the dark that followed the light. To 'extinguish' was absolute.
Now this was a real threat.   
  
Silence. No objections? That's a welcome change of pace, T'hauer thought.   
*"Poison words of traitors!"*, another proxy hissed. Of course, the Hrese Federation. They also shared the Balance the Strength. But unlike the white ones, they didn't have to fight to acquire it.  
*"Scales be my witnesses, even goodwill has boundaries. You are unworthy of your place among us and yet you still object. You even dare to clad your lies in loyalty!"*, the spindly, insect-like being swore at him, *"If you continue on this path we won't stand idly by while you ally with other unbalanced creatures and threaten the Conscious."*  
  
The white one leaned his head slightly, pitch black eyes meeting the crimson red stare. When he had peered into the mind of so many humans, he had found some interesting word combinations and concepts that had been somewhat abstract in the beginning, but were slowly growing on him anyway. Sometimes he even found himself using them without realizing it. So he searched his memories and picked out a fitting response.    
*"Try me."* Two words, no echo. And a Hrese proxy left dumbfounded.  
His nostrils stretched to a wide smile. *"That's what I thought."* Then the form of his organic projection started to wither away, crumbling into smaller and smaller dusty, white flakes.   
  
Moments later T'hauer found himself standing back on a deck of his ship. A Cumulus class cluster-dreadnought without weapons or shields. One of few still living 'originals' and flagship of the White Fleet - The 'Last Light'. This and feeling his true body again relieved him somewhat. Compared to it, using a organic projection was like being stuffed into a tiny box for a few hours.   
He stretched his long fingers, taking a first step with his stump-like legs and the ground surface beneath him shivered in response. Signals of light pulsed out and into his body, causing bright waves of energy to unfurl from his feet.   
*"We welcome you back, Sequence of Thousands."*, a soft voice intruded on him. M'hira, Sequence of Hundreds. Dissimilar to his, the echoes of her words were slower, more deliberate, like single drops of water hitting the surface of a still lake.    
*"Greetings."*, he responded, *"What's the status of our fleet, M'hira?"*   
*"Sequence..."*, she frowned, somehow even making it noticeable through mind's voice.  
*"Sequence?"*, he asked.  
*"Sequence of Hundreds."*  
*"Oh, of course."*, T'hauer realized, *"What is the status of our fleet, ehm...Sequence of Hundreds?"*  
  
There was a moment of silence. But then she luckily continued.    
*"The White Fleet is currently split and on standby here."* A signal of light entered his body, and another.   *"And here."*  
He instantly knew. It was like someone displaying a holographic map in his mind with two blinking dots, but instead of him having to look at it and process the data he just knew. Like he had experienced being there on his own.  
*"The Last Light also has reached its destination while you were with the Conscious. We are now positioned on the far side of Earth's moon."*, M'hira added.  
T'hauer walked across the deck, letting it pulse beneath him like taking steps on shallow water. Thick roots beneath thin, transparent walls shrunk away in his path, creating doorways where there were none. The concept of static layouts with rooms, halls and doors was long lost to the white ones.   
Everything they needed grew for its function alone and withered away again soon after it fullfilled this purpose. A higher Sequence gave a white one more aptitude over what he could change. Though they didn't need much. The moment they stepped onto the ship they were part of it. And it was part of them.    
    
A small room formed around T'hauen and in its middle a small, oval chair in white, as was everything around.  
*"Is... is everything alright, Sequence of Thousands?"*, M'hira noticed. Since their contact with humanity T'hauer had changed.  
*"Actually I feel pretty good"*, he answered sitting down, oddly satisfied with himself.  
*"How long are we going to stay here?"*, she asked carefully. Normally she would never ask a question like that, even if she was curious. But he seemed different, more casual for some reason.  
*"Hm, a few hundred earthen years at most, I guess. Just to be sure."*, he said while trying to find the right position to lean back with moderate success. How was it again?  
Just an acknowledging but slightly suprised *"Oh."* echoed from M'hira, probably not even intentionally vocalized. The white species was old, very old - ancient to human standards even. But that didn't mean time just flew by for them either.   
Then she realized what her superior was doing. To get comfortable was really their only option right now.
