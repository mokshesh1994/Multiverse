And he, the fool that held the title of Supreme OverCommander of the entire Pssh'frrrt fleet had made the sorry mistake to believe them.

Damn 'experts'.

Now the human workforce who was responsible for cleaning the landing decks were gone, as well as one of the shuttles... and one poor shuttle technician who had fallen victim for the violent and persuasive humans.

Fuck!!! The only real advantage they'd had over the humans had been the secrecy of their base of operations' location. Within a couple of hours this would no longer be the case.

The Supreme OverCommander looked around... noone seemed to look his way right now, they were probably too scared...

Twelve seconds later a lone shuttle with a lone passenger, well, pilot, had made its way through the atmospheric force shild and activated its SpaceBend generator.

In a blinding flash, Supreme OverCommander Blck'Vlvt was gone.
