Would you go back?

Stephen tried hard to think of the first thing he remembered.  It was a warm summers day at the beach.  His mother and father were running with him, dodging the foamy waves as they made inroads onto the shimmering sand.  He could hear his parents laugh, so much in love.  But they loved him too, most of all.  An arm scooped him up from somewhere behind, and Stephen remembered sitting down on someones shoulders, wrapping his own arms around a head with flowing blonde hair.  Look, she said, directing his gaze upward, its raining through the sun!

Stephen slowed down, panting, and realized he was thirsty.  It hadnt been a particularly hot day, and they hadnt run very far, but he had skipped breakfast and had to throw away his milk carton half-full.  As he rounded the last corner on the track in the stadium, he saw the familiar minivan parked near the bleachers.  It was her again.  She waved but he turned away, scared that his friends would laugh.  Everyone liked his dad more.  There you are! she called out.  Stephen didnt remember his exact words, only that they were an angsty teenage reply.  Looking back he realized the sadness in her smile.  She would always love him.  Stephen tried hard, but couldnt remember if that was the day they had found the cancer.  Maybe it was the next week after his birthday party, or maybe they had been at home.  He gave up trying.

The name hadnt mattered to Stephen until she was born.  His wife had chosen it, and although he didnt think it fit at the time, he eventually found it quaint and endearing.  Theyd met five years ago, right before he graduated.  Or maybe it was after he graduated but before he got his job?  His dad had died four months after their wedding.  He couldnt stop drinking so they could never add him to the transplant list.  His mother had passed away years before after the final round of chemotherapy had failed, while Stephen himself had begun to experience that same pain in his own back.

Stephen had told himself he would make it to his daughter's wedding, and he felt a genuine sense of satisfaction when it was over.  Everything their friends had said would happened did happen, even better than they thought possible.  His oncologist had called in a special request for the smaller tank, but he still didnt like the cannula in his nose.  It smelled like vanilla, but he couldnt take too many breaths without it.  Three weeks later he closed his eyes in the simulation for the final time.

Stephen leaned forward on the small bed in the strange new room as the associate opened the door slowly and quietly.  They both appeared to be about 22.  They shook hands.  The associate was elated and effusive, but somehow managed to carry on with the explanation.  His world had been simulated in order to study human nature, but the simulation was imperfect and so it had gone faster.  Maybe it was 500 times faster than reality?  Stephen thought the associate said 500.  They had selected him out of a cohort of 28 to carry through into the "real" world, so that they could work together and continue to learn.  Some of the others had been excluded for certain reasons, according to the associate.  One had been hit by a car in his world and sank into a coma, so they stopped learning and eventually terminated that instance.  Others had committed serious crimes and so could not be carried through, or they had led more mundane lives, so that there wasn't as much to learn.  Stephen was curious why they didnt choose to bring back the politician.

The hall stretched out before them, resembling one you might find in an office building but somehow different.  Maybe it looked like a hospital?  There were display boards at regular intervals.  He realized that he had woken up in these clothes and began to feel curious about what he was wearing.  But that didnt really matter.  They finally slowed down near one of the doors and the associate tried to contain his excitement.  He opened the door and in a few short moments the meeting began.

Part of why we chose you was that you faced many struggles in your life and overcame them, the man said.  Stephen wasnt sure if the man was a doctor, or even what system of government existed in this real world.  But it seemed as though the man knew him well.  How much of the simulation had he watched?  You made mistakes, but overall, you made many good choices.  Stephen tried his best to make conversation during the meeting, although he knew they could have seen everything.  Which one of his memories made them laugh or cry?  Were they even that invested?

Eventually he laid down in his bed; the orientation was a week-long process and he tried to keep things straight in his head.  Apparently the simulations were accurate.  They had tried to keep as much as possible the same.  Stephen couldnt hold back the tears, but maybe they knew this.  Maybe they had deliberately ended the meeting early.  He cried for hours as he used up all the tissues they had stocked in his room.  Eventually Stephen fell asleep and dreamed about whether he would ever go back.  As part of his learning, he could review any part of his simulation trajectory.  He could even do it in the first person perspective, although they explained that it would seem as though he were a puppet as his movements could not be changed.  As Stephen woke up and gazed through the window, he noticed a very light rain.
