Running

I  was running for our life. I was running after the traitor. I was shouting his name, i knew that he gave us out for the other tribe. I knew that i have to reach him, and bash his head in to save our tribe. I was fast, faster than the tribe running with me, behind me, but he was faster. 
And then he stumbled on a spot of mud. I reached for his arm, my axe caved his temple in, and I knew that our tribe is safe now. 
I looked back triumphantly for the tribe.
The tribe standing still, with the suspicion slowly replacing the victory in their eyes.
The tribe which started to run towards me.
Shouting my name.
Calling me a traitor.
I was running for my life.

The Training Leader was looking at the results with a happy little smile. Those bunch of apes are improving much better and quicker than the lizards they tried to uplift a few million years ago. And this happened because of his new training regime. The apes have lost hair, their body position became more vertical, they were running faster now. In just a few generations they will be able to survive in the spreading grasslands, thus starting another civilization, another space faring species. 
The only side-effect, the mild paranoia surely will not be the cause of any problems on the long run.
