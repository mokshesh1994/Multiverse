 I thought to myself, Im not safe anymore.

The small stones crunched beneath my feet as I fell to floor. My chest tightened. 
Dr. N said, Just breathe deep; focus outward. His voice was so calming. What is a marine with fear? A coward. Thats what the lieutenant called me before he spat on me and threw me in here. 

Blinded by fear, they said I reloaded and emptied another magazine at my unit. Brothers at arms; a war seeped out of me Ive been battling for years. The tears stopped a few hours ago but the remorse is its paralyzing. 

Dr. N understands. In Afghanistan, where the lost are given a purpose; mine is to kill, his to heal. I ran as far away as I could to forget Mommas decline and my sisters fanaticism. Drugs or religion, thats what keeps them sane, I dont have either.

Dr. N will keep them from me. Hell keep them out of here. Fear roots out all compassion. He said its the burden we carry. We need to root out those old demons that have made our lives a nightmare.

I know hell help me. If I have another attack Ill just take this pill he gave me. Ill need it when; the guards, those guys come back. Theyre walking this way. 
Dear God Help me! I fumbled in the darkness shoving the pill in my mouth, washed with the flood of tears. 

The room was white cold and bare, sterile; except, there was an emptiness, a void. There had never been a thing here, until me.
That pill brought me here. The voice, a distant voice, warm and welcoming says, Welcome Jake, I am here now. You are safe in my hands.
I cant see his face but I lay in his arms, bright and inviting, a heat radiates through my body. Im finally safe.

The voice again, I am Saoroq of the 8th dimension. I will be your spirit guide to carry you through this journey.
I dont comprehend but my spirit is willing.
Saoroq says, You are haunted by the demons of your past; conquered by fear. Like many great men before you, you react without understanding. I will let you break free.

I looked up and saw his face. It seemed familiar but alien, perfectly sculpted, a milky white like Italian marble. His eyes were red with billowing smoke that peered into you, its intensity fanned like a campfire in the nights wind each time he spoke.  He was alien. He was loving. He was the hope I needed.

Saoroq said, You must fight those demons that have held you captive. I will be your shadow in the darkness. Every felled enemy will bring you to the light, until there is no more shadow. Until there is just you in the presence of your dynamic power.

I looked on as his red embroidered tunic waved as he stretched out his hand. In it was a crude weapon. It was a crudely formed knife; short, rusted with tape for a handle. It felt weightless, as I felt confident each time I gripped handle. 


I felt the darkness caving all around me, swallowing me whole in its serpentine belly of doubt. I looked down at my hand, the knife, the power. I lunged forward connecting with the fleshy abdomen of a demon. I swung wildly stabbing until I could make out the forms surrounding me. One was on the ground. The light was dim. I couldnt see. I needed more light. 

I could feel Saoroqs hand on my shoulder. He was there, watching, believing. I lunged at the three figures to my left, falling to the ground narrowly escaping a foot to my face. I rose with confidence, focused. I dodged left and stabbed the neck of one, pivoting and throwing all of my weight into the body of another. I could feel the others punching kicking, beating me. I swung wildly as I regained my footing. I smiled sensing their fear. Unbound to my fears, my past, my demons. I ran back as the demon hoard attempted to circle around me. Taking them two and three at a time, I was the victor.

I stood over the felled demon hoard, feeling the light engulf me. Unbound, the smell, taste, noise of the World came rushing back. I felt the power surging, a velodrome of colors racing through and around me. The glory, the power returned as I steeled my spirit in the beautiful moment. This was my release. I was reborn. I was renewed.

Dr. Nestorius stood in the mess hall as the General debriefed the staff.

The General towered over the gallery of men perched on a bench, We believe the fugitive escaped into the mountains outside of Tora Bora. We will be sending air recon to find him. Hes on foot and we dont believe hell get far.

Dr. Nestorius shuffled in the dirt as he anticipated the next details.

The General said, There were 11 men killed outside his cell last night. There are still 4 soldiers from his company in surgery that he wounded during a firefight. 

The General leaned in as he pointed to the marines, He is no longer a soldier or a brother. He is our enemy now. Engage him with extreme prejudice.

Dr. Nestorius smiled and thought, 11 men dead. 12 souls sacrificed. The prophecy is fulfilled.
Dr. N looked towards the flimsy door out of the mess hall as the morning light peeked in. He began to swell with pride. Dr. N had traveled across the World to find a suitable host. A potent combination of fear and desperation was necessary to fulfill the prophecy. He mixed that deadly cocktail with a pill given to Jake. It was a success. A new war on terror had begun. Saoroq the Destroyer was reborn. He was hungry. His stone body had become flesh. It was time to gather the worshippers.
