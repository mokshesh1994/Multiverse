*Everyone* will be present? Otric asked as he followed Zhou through the winding grey tunnels, a roll of papers under his arm. 

&nbsp;

Yes, Golog will be there. The bald man replied. Like Otric, Zhou was dressed formally, wearing a pitch black suit with a golden lapel pin in the shape of a hand. 

&nbsp;

Well then. Otric grumbled running a hand over his slicked back hair, feeling the scarification on his forehead. His own pin was in the shape of a golden dragon, encircling a flower. Of all the members of TSIG, Golog was easily the one he liked the least. 

&nbsp;

I am amazed the two of you have managed to get any work done together. Zhou said, waving at the massive blast door in front of them, which began to rumble open with the speed of a glacier. After maybe four years of working with you, I have never once seen you two get along cordially.

&nbsp;

She and I have agreed to keep our mutual dislike out of our work. Otric said, shifting his hold on the package. Despite his professionally tailored suit, Otric felt naked. Some soldiers thought of their armor like a second skin after spending so much time in it, but for Otric it was somewhat more literal. After years of careful enhancements, the only organic parts of his body left were his head and spinal column. Even then, they were peppered with dozens of augments, ranging from artificial eyes to a ceramic/steel coating over the bones, and neural boosters to reduce reaction times. The rest of his being was cold hard metal. When your armor connects directly to your nervous system, or what is left of it, going without it made Otrics world feel much smaller, and much deadlier.  

&nbsp;

Could have fooled me. Zhou said as the doors open, revealing a dark room with a circular table in the centre. Small cameras watched every angle, scanning the two TSIG members from head to toe. 

&nbsp;

Taking their spots in a pair of high backed iron chairs, Otric and Zhou pressed their pins into small recesses within the table and waited while the blast door dropped, sealing them in total darkness. 

&nbsp;

Identity verified. The cool voice of the system replied. Connecting to conference.

&nbsp;

Hidden projectors came to life, and faint light filled the room as the holographic forms of TSIGs high command materialized around the table. There were four others, one man and three women.

&nbsp;

Connection established. Connection: Mars, Terrence Holt. Designate: King, YOULING. Connection: Saturn, Valla. Designate: Queen, LIEREN. Connection: Saturn, Angela Yong. Designate: Queen, SUPREME. Connection: Oort Cloud, Kamina Golog. Designate: King, SUPREME. Connection: Earth, Otric. Designate: King, LIEREN. Connection: Earth, Oren Zhou. Designate: Queen, YOULING, Association Arbiter. Not present: Designate: King of Kings. Days since last attendance: 2107. The tally of attendees complete, the computer silenced itself leaving only the faint crackle of static from the projectors. 

&nbsp;

Welcome back. Zhou said, nodding at each person individually. It has been several weeks since we last convened together, but given the events at Mnn Consela, it is high time we regroup and decide our organizations future. Holt, you have the floor.

&nbsp;

The King of the YOULING branch nodded and stood up, his massive bushy beard rendered faithfully by the elaborate systems hidden within the Vault. The trial outcome was mixed overall. It is beneficial to us that the Black Room is now a known and hunted terrorist group, however the fact that the Grand Prosecutor has decided to temporally seize control of every human council seat is unpleasant. In the very near future, we should expect a heavily armed diplomatic convoy to arrive from the capitol, carrying the aliens bureaucrats who will oversee the Sol system for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the Council has decided to continue to deport the human refugees back to Sol, and seize the world of Terra Nova, along with the homes of all the early settlers. These settlers will also be sent back to Sol. The resulting refugee crisis will be disastrous for us.

&nbsp;

Worst case scenario. Golog said, her voice as cold and mechanical as Otrics body. The head of the SUPREME division was one of the only people who was more machine than Otric, with only her brain remaining. The rest of Kamina Gologs body was utterly unnatural, with a humanesque torso mounted upon the body of spider, like some bizarre centaur. 

&nbsp;

War. Otric took pleasure in seeing her grimace when he spoke. The fact that he had any valuable input always seemed to rub her the wrong way. The system will have too many people and not enough food or shelter. Many of the nutrition farms on Earth have already been shut down after their workers fled to the rest of the galaxy, by the time they can be staffed by trained workers millions will have died from starvation. Europa and the other offworld colonies will unlikely to supply aid without being forced by someone, which is what the Council will certainly do. The outskirts of the Earths mega cities have already begun to fall into disrepair, and more will die without proper radiation shielding. Unrest will be high, conflict will be inevitable. 

&nbsp;

Can anyone else back up his statement? Golog asked, looking to the rest of the gathered leaders. 

&nbsp;

You know damn well I am right. Otric replied. 

&nbsp;

I want another persons opinion. 

&nbsp;

Zhou raised his hand, and so did Valla. I support my brothers conclusion. Valla said. She had decided to wear her helmet, the featureless oval making an odd combination with the elaborate and ornate uniform. It will be very bloody, and it will hurt humanity more than the Council. Nip this in the bud, or be prepared to go on a massive offensive and bring the fight to them.  

&nbsp;

What counted for Gologs head made its best imitation of a nod, the jerky motion pulling the scientist even closer to the Uncanny Valley. Very well. I will retask several of my Bishops to weapons research and development.  

&nbsp;

I have already made strides in experimental weapons. Dr. Yong said. As you know, the main limitation of Ether weapons are the heat sinks. Unless they are mounted on vehicles or ships, they cannot dissipate heat fast enough for them to be useful in prolonged engagements. However, many of our soldiers already carry close combat weapons for battles where ammo may be scarce or they are in close quarters. Some of these, a mace or great sword for example, have enough mass that with minor modifications they can be used as heatsinks for the Ether projectors. In essence, I can give us lightning swords. I have several prototypes ready for field testing, and if they go well I can provide Zhou or Holt the necessary schematics to begin mass producing them for all our forces.

&nbsp;

Send me that info, regardless of testing. Holt cut in. Orbital Shipyards owns Talamar, they can get us 10000 off-the-book units of any design by the end of the month.

&nbsp;

The hologram of Angela Yong tapped at something that Otric could not see. Plans sent to you. 

&nbsp;

What of our ships? Valla again. 

&nbsp;

Voidworks has already stepped up production under the guise of expanding our market to the rest of the galaxy. Of course we have already purchased the orders via a shell company. Zhou replied.  By the end of the year we will have two battlecruisers, two carriers, one titan, five battleships, two dozen destroyers, and 30 cruisers. This is not counting personal ships. In addition, we have already started on the prototype capitol ship Otric and Yong designed.

&nbsp;

An impressive fleet for such a short time span, Zhou. But I want to be able to kill every last alien that comes within a lightyear of here, and if the Council moves in force we will lose even if you do manage to meet that deadline. 

&nbsp;

That is where I come in. Otric said, unfurling one of the large rolls of paper he had onto a scanner hidden within the table, allowing the projectors to show everyone what he was planning. YOULING engineers have already begun renovating the orbital and ground defenses of every major colony. When they are finished, we wont need a fleet. Any alien ship that jumps in will die the instant it gets close to a planet. The New Tokyo orbital plate already has an operational Ether projector that can gore anything smaller than a capitol ship in a single shot that gets within three lightseconds of Earth.

&nbsp;

A purely defensive solution that is only viable for the short term. Golog sniffed in derision. It does not matter if we can keep our system safe if we still have many billions of deposed refugees draining supplies. The Council will blockade us, and wait until the people have revolted.

&nbsp;

A short term solution can give us time for a long term one. Unless you have a suggestion, I suggest you hold your tongue. 

&nbsp;

What about the Black Room? Holt said. They wont take to kindly to us building weapons on the colonies, especially not Europa.

&nbsp;

In a perfect world they would realize that our efforts would benefit them as well, but this is not a perfect world. And we did just watch them get shit on by the Council, so tensions may be high. So, I sent the Council the location of one of the known Black Room research bases, the ship orbiting near the sun, through clandestine channels. It cant be traced back to us. That will keep them busy for a little bit, dealing with that plug. In addition, I have tasked one of my agents, Amina DeWolfe, to hunting down anyone who may be able to reveal that the Black Room is not responsible for the Terra Nova incident.

&nbsp;

The business man nodded in agreement. That should be sufficient for now. At least until we can open proper channels of communication. For my part, Orbital Shipyards is in the process of opening several major factories in non-human systems. To ensure this organization will have an outside cash flow.  

&nbsp;

Is there anything else someone would like to add to the discussion? Zhou said, standing up once again. 

&nbsp;

While the CEO was not looking, Otric pressed one of the recessed buttons set into his chair sending a simple pulse to Golog. The artificial head made the most minimal of all turns to look in his direction before turning back to Zhou.

&nbsp;

No? On my end, I have already sent my Bishops and Knights out to begin talking with the heads of various governments. To ensure a degree of cooperation or to replace them quickly when shit hits the fan. Everyone knows what is needed of them? Good. Make sure to keep everyone updated, we will do this together. Finally, it is time for me to step down from my position of Association Arbiter. Taking my place for the next year will be Angela Yong, I will send you the details later. Meeting over. Zhou shot a glance at Otric and Golog before disconnecting. 

&nbsp;

One by one, the holograms of the other kings and queens of TSIG flickered and deactivated, leaving Otric and Zhou in the darkness. Behind them, the great blast door began to crawl upwards, letting a thin slice of light into the room. 

&nbsp;

Are you coming? Zhou asked when Otric did not move.

&nbsp;

In a moment. 

&nbsp;

The leader of YOULING sat in silence until the great blast door closed behind Zhou. Golog. He said, voice barely more than a whisper.

&nbsp;

Otric. The old scientist replied, loudly, her hologram reappearing. Why do you want to talk to me, kid?

&nbsp;

If you are going to insult my age at the very least do it when I am not giving you the long term plan you wanted. Besides, for someone who hates nepotism, you pulled a lot of strings to make me give DeWolfe a Rook position.

&nbsp;

Another grunt from Golog. That is different. She had proven herself to be exceptionally talented. I only sped up the process that was already going to happen.

&nbsp;

And I am not exceptional? Was I not one of the most successful Bishops in YOULINGs history? Did I not prove myself as both a fighter and a commander?

&nbsp;

There is a difference between going from a Pawn to a Rook versus going from a Bishop to a King. You and I both know your sister specifically chose you to take over her position even though there were many people just as talented as you.

&nbsp;

It was true. Valla had not wanted the position of King any longer, and had selected Otric as her successor without even considering the alternatives. Regardless of how she chose, you must admit I have an exemplary record. 

&nbsp;

When you are as young as you are, that is easy. You have less than twenty years of experience total. Sheila Caman had three perfect decades before she became a Bishop, and another two before she became Queen. The same goes for Indrik Dartmouth, Hadrian Borson, Talia Winters, and Vols Tront. Are you saying you are more qualified than all of them?

&nbsp;

Yes. But that is beside the point, not that you can see it way out in the Oort cloud. Otric took the slightest bit of pleasure in seeing Golog frown. The point is that we are going to be under siege. You said it yourself.

&nbsp;

I did. Do you have a solution?

&nbsp;

Perhaps. It depends on how good you are. 

&nbsp;

If the natural laws of the universe permit it, I will find a way to do it.

&nbsp;

And if the universe disagrees?

&nbsp;

It will take me a bit longer.

&nbsp;

By all rights, Gologs age meant she should have vacated her position as King of SUPREME many years ago. However, if there were any two people in TSIG who could find a way to twist reality to their whims, it would be the two of them. But that was if they didnt twist the others head off first.

&nbsp;

How is your research on large scale Ether transportation going?

&nbsp;

Another frown from Golog. You found out.

&nbsp;

It took me a while. I had to rely on the Echo Choir to confirm it. 

&nbsp;

Hah! Hahaha! It was unnatural hearing her laugh, like it was a voice sounding out the letters rather than actually doing the action. You actually trust the Choir that much? The Choir? Really?

&nbsp;

Answer the question Golog. Otric said, trying to ignore her jab. The Echo Choir was the most advanced prediction engine in the universe, and regardless of what anyone said about its accuracy rate Otric still considered its advice useful. 

&nbsp;

It is coming along. The main difficulty is overcoming Ether drain. Once I get past that, it should be smooth sailing. The spider-centaur idly traced an equation in the air with a silver arm, dozens of symbols rendered in green light. 

&nbsp;

Ether drain? I am unfamiliar with the term.

&nbsp;

Of course you are. Golog smirked. The short and sweet explanation for a ground pounder like you is that the more power a certain area in realspace is drawing from the Ether, the lower the overall throughput of power is. Turn on too many taps, and you lose your water pressure. Same principle as plumbing. Ever wonder why Mnn Consela was chosen to be the capitol of the galaxy, besides its location near the core? There are enough storms on that world for the wind and hydro plants to supply everything that does not absolutely require Ether power.

&nbsp;

What if the object that we were trying to move was directly in the Ether? Like the way the Zo travel through space. Otric had never encountered the predatory species personally, but he had read extensive reports. One of only two species to access the Ether with their natural biology, they could travel between planets and even solar systems by jumping into that alternate dimension.

&nbsp;

Possible. I would need to study the creatures more closely. In addition, there is the problem with the Ether itself. Golog was still tracing equations in the air, few of which Otric could understand, let alone name all the variables. All that energy in the Ether, all the potential It warps time and space. Before you ask, no it is not time travel. To simplify it for you, it is like looking ahead a few pages in a book. Or a version of your precious Echo Choir. That is likely why the Zo are so hard to fight, they keep on seeing flashes of what will happen. Then of course there is the fact you are in a reality composed almost entirely of free energy. Something travelling through the Ether would have to be heavily protected and insulated to survive the journey.

&nbsp;

Back to the Zo. If I got you enough samples, could you figure out the solution? For the first time in years, Otrics hand twitched from nervousness. If this did not work, then it was quite possible humanity would be right back where it started: struggling to survive in a solar system that didnt care for it, kept alive by only the barest margins. The slums of The Hague were bad enough without a group of idiotic alien bureaucrats trying to run them humanely. 

&nbsp;

Yes, I could. Golag said without a hint of doubt in her voice. Could her voice even convey doubt, or had she programmed that out?

&nbsp;

What is the largest thing you could transport?

&nbsp;

That depends. What were you thinking of?

&nbsp;

Otric laid the other set of blueprints on the scanner. 

&nbsp;

I- uh. Wow. I- Im not sure. Maybe? I can try, I dont see why the math wouldnt work, but uh Are you sure? Well that answered the question about doubt. 

&nbsp;

Absolutely. Say the word, and I will provide you with everything you need.

&nbsp;

Golog paused for a minute, hands frantically writing in the air for a solid minute as she worked through the problem. It shall be done. She said at last.

&nbsp;

A pleasure doing business with you doctor. Do not tell anyone else of this until we are certain it will work. I dont want Holt throwing a fit because we are thinking of stealing one of his precious orbital plates.

&nbsp;

A nod was all the confirmation Otric needed. He removed the pin from the recess in the table and stuck it back to the lapel of his suit. He was still nervous, but hope and excitement had joined it. If it worked It would be beautiful. Closing his eyes, Otric allowed himself to imagine the future.
