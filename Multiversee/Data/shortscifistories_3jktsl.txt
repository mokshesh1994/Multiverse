Starlight

The stars went out today.

*The universe dies not in a bang, but in a gentle expansion until all energy is diffused, made useless.*

The stars went out the second we turned it on.

*This expansion and cooling is the inevitable fate of everything. Eventually, all the stars will burn down. What do we do then?*

The machine provides a hard point in time. It enables travel through time, but only to a specific moment. That is, the moment we turn it on.

*Where will we reach when the universe is cold and dying?*

We turned on the machine. 

And the stars were stolen.
