Shining Sword: First Trial (Pt. 1)
Estellus
(Hi there! Some of you might remember I wrote a [thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/41mr5a/oc_he_walks_among_them/
) a few months ago and promised more once the world was ready(readier). Well, OP delivers. It's a very different feel than the first piece, but set in the same universe, and is actually a prequel of sorts. Please comment your thoughts, opinions, and potentially needed edits. Be mean. I love commentary or advice on the matter of plot and narrative structuring especially.

In the effort of avoiding confusion, Dubhlainn is a traditional Irish name, and Irish is a weird language. It's pronounced **Dove**-linn, roughly.)

&nbsp;

"We're approaching the transition point, sir," the lieutenant at the navigation station said.

&nbsp;

Commodore Dubhlainn O'Brian glanced over at the holo-display in front of her from his pulpit in the back of the bridge. After a moment to judge time to the destination, the flag officer turned and looked down the center of the long room, sipping from the cup of tea in his hand. A row of consoles ran down either side of the room, facing in towards a pair of large holo-tanks. The forward tank displayed a giant, fully detailed rendition of the ship which surrounded the command deck. The smaller, rear tank was directly in front of and below the commodore's pulpit, and was currently inactive.

The commodore turned to look at one of the other officers, clasping his hands behind him and resisting the urge to smooth his dark blue naval jacket.

&nbsp;

"Lieutenant Singh, give me battlegroup disposition in the tac-tank."

&nbsp;

"Sir! Battlegroup disposition in the tactical tank, sir," responded the eager young man, pressing several buttons on his console. A moment later, the rear holo-tank shimmered to life, displaying a real-time representation of Battlegroup Shining Sword.

&nbsp;

At the front of the formation were the Draco (5)-class frigates *Gan Jiang* and *Mo Ye*. Holding the rear of the formation were two more frigates, the *Kladenets* and the *Sharur*. On the left and right flanks were the Mantis-class corvettes *Dirk* and *Dagger*. At the top and bottom of the formation were the more muscular Constellation-class cruisers *Tyrfing* and *Caladbolg*. Together, the warships of Battlegroup Shining Sword formed a loose orb of overlapping gunnery lanes and defense fields, sheltering their heart, and their sword, from unexpected attack. 
That heart was six hundred and seventy four meters long, weighing in at over one million long tonnes; Solar Commonwealth Naval Ship *Dyrnwyn*, the first of her class of battlecruisers, intended to eventually replace the older Armizare-class ships.
Surveying the disposition in the holo-tank, the fiery-haired commodore allowed himself a proud smile, before wiping it from his face and turning his mind to the task at hand. He raised his voice, addressing the bridge as a whole, his brogue breaking through at times.

&nbsp;

"Alroight people! We don't know what to expect when we breach, so I want everyone on full combat footing. Sound general quarters," he said, then looked to the men and women watching him from the stations along the larger forward tank.
"Shield control, angle our scales for the strongest one 'undred-eighty degree forward coverage yeh can give me."

&nbsp;

"Yes sir," chorused the men and women in the forward stations, who turned back to their consoles. The shimmering image of *Dyrnwyn* displayed in the forward tank shifted, showing the shifts in the scale-shield emitters as they angled forward, forming a cone in front of the battlecruiser, but leaving the aft almost completely bare.

&nbsp;

Dubhlainn's attention shifted to the tactical tank below the pulpit, barking at another man at a console near his own.


"Comms!"

&nbsp;

"Yes, sir?"

&nbsp;

"Raise the battlegroup. Relate the followin' formation changes..." he said, and began to detail the modifications, eye locked on the tank. As he spoke, the attendant warships began to move.


*Tyrfing* and *Caladbolg* fell back and rotated, forming a horizontal wedge with *Dyrnwyn* as the tip. *Mo Ye* and *Gan Jiang* elevated and fell back as well, taking position 'above' the cruisers, while *Sharur* and *Kladenets* accelerated to position beneath the cruisers. The small corvettes moved into the center of the blunt wedge, sheltering between the cruisers, within the engine wash of the battlecruiser, where their signals might be hidden from long-range sensors, but where they could still receive laser-comms from the *Dyrnwyn*.



Once his assets were positioned to his liking, Dubhlainn turned back to the navigation officer who had spoken first.
"Time to breach point, lieutenant?"

&nbsp;

The young woman looked up at him and licked her lips nervously, then back to her display.


"Two minutes, sir."

&nbsp;

"First time?"

&nbsp;

She looked at him, confused. "Sir?"

&nbsp;

"In a potential combat situation, Lieutenant Cooke."

&nbsp;

"Oh-sir, yes sir," she blushed slightly.

&nbsp;

"Nothing to be ashamed of, lass. Keep your head, and we'll all be okay."

&nbsp;

"Sir, thank you sir," she said, smiling hesitantly at the flag officer, before turning back to her station.



"One minute thirty at current speed, sir."

&nbsp;

Commodore O'Brian pressed a button on his console, opening a direct line to gunnery control, several decks away.


"Commander Korchenkov?" he said, then, while waiting for a reply, turned back to Lieutenant Cooke.


"Lisa, put the breach timer into the tac-tank, over the fleet. Clear it as soon as we breach."


He turned back to his console, ignoring her affirmative reply, as the speaker crackled.

&nbsp;

"Da, captain, gunnery here."

&nbsp;

The commodore smiled to himself. Sinyushkans had some strange ideas about military formality, which he found he didn't mind.
"We're breaching in-" he glanced at the timer Lisa Cooke had transfered to the secondary holo-tank. "-one minute, commander. Status?"

&nbsp;

"Rails are varmed up in the turrets, ser. Solids loaded for first two rounds in each. After that, we will adjust ammo based on target. Plasma carronades are loaded, but not cooking. Hopefully we won't need them, da?"

&nbsp;

"Hopefully."


O'Brian cut the connection and looked at the timer again.

&nbsp;

>0:45

&nbsp;

He drained the last of his tea, then locked the metal mug, emblazoned with the Commonwealth Navy crest, in the holder beneath his chair.

&nbsp;

>0:30

&nbsp;

"Lieutenant Dubois, fleetwide," he said to the communications officer.

&nbsp;

"Sir, fleetwide live, sir!"

&nbsp;

Dubhlainn leaned against the pulpit, eyes locked on the holographic ships in the tac-tank.


"Shining Sword, this is Commodore Dubhlainn O'Brian aboard the *Dyrnwyn*. In less than thirty seconds we will be surfacing from divespace. We have no information on what will be waiting for us, but whatever we find, we will stand tall and do justice to our nations. I'm proud to have each and every one of you under my command. Battlestations." He made a gesture at his throat, and lieutenant Dubois cut the transmission.

&nbsp;

>0:05

&nbsp;

Throughout the ships of Commonwealth Battlegroup Shining Sword, purple lights began to flash, warning all hands to prepare for realspace emergence. 

&nbsp;

>0:01

&nbsp;

Commodore O'Brian leaned against his pulpit, arms tense, eyes locked on the holo display.

&nbsp;

>0:00

&nbsp;


&nbsp;


In an empty, dead star system on the edge of Commonwealth space, the void buckled. A round window into another reality opened.

&nbsp;

The first thing that entered reality was a beautiful woman. Her right arm extended forward, clutching a sword shrouded in flame, while her left held a harp to her body. Her form was wrapped in old-fashioned armor, but her head was bare, and her hair seemed to blow back behind her, wrapping around the prow of the ship she led into battle. As her prow slid into the system, *Dyrnwyn*'s scales hummed online, projecting an invisible layer of protections in front of her figurehead.

&nbsp;

In but a moment, the entirety of Shining Sword had returned to realspace. 


On the bridge of SCNS *Dyrnwyn*, alarms began to sound.


At the sensory suite, Lieutenant Augustus Singh spun and shouted at his commander.


"Sir! I'm detecting unknown ship signatures within realtime range!"

&nbsp;

O'Brian gestured towards the tactical tank, speaking quickly but calmly.


"Show me relative positions, and give me classifications or best approximation as soon as they're available."

&nbsp;

The young officer nodded the affirmative and turned back to his console. A moment later, the image of Shining Sword shrank to a corner of the holo-tank, and a group of unidentified signals appeared. Commodore O'Brian manipulated several controls on his own pulpit, and a series of rings appeared around Shining Sword, displaying the effective range of their various armaments, and revealing what he already suspected; the enemy formation was well within firing range of his longest range weapons, nearly on top of him in relation to the vastness of space.

&nbsp;

"Singh, do we have relative mass measurements yet?"

&nbsp;

"Yes, sir."

&nbsp;

"Send the information to Lisa's console and keep working. Lisa, tag the signals in the tank numerically from largest to smallest."

&nbsp;

"Sir," the two said in unison, fingers flying across their terminals. The flag officer pressed the gunnery intercom again.

&nbsp;

"Illarion, you see them?"

"Da, captain."

&nbsp;

"Generate firing solutions on every target and angle our guns towards them, but don't actually target them."

&nbsp;

"Already done, comrade."

&nbsp;

"Of course it is." The commodore looked back into his own holo-tank, the signals now numbered by mass.


"Dubois, stand by to record a message."

&nbsp;

"Ready, sir," said the communications officer, and a holographic white microphone appeared in the tank in front of Dubhlainn, a red cross through it. He nodded to the man, and the cross disappeared.

&nbsp;

"Unidentified vessels, this is Commodore Dubhlainn O'Brian, of the Solar Commonwealth Battlegroup Shining Sword. Please identify yourselves and state your intentions." He made the cutting gesture again, and the cross flashed over the image of the microphone.


"Dubois, I want you to broadcast that on every frequency, directed at each of those signals. Automatically repeat it every," he paused for a moment, fingers drumming on the pulpit. "Thirty seconds, until we receive either a message or hostile action in reply. Alert me once you have it set."

&nbsp;

As the communications officer went to work, he turned back to the tank. Manipulating the controls on his pulpit, he separated the display into two; one that showed the relative disposition of his ships and the unknown contacts, the other a close in zoom of Shining Sword, with detail highlighting shield positioning.

&nbsp;

"Sir, message is broadcasting every thirty seconds as requested, to all unidentified contacts." Dubois said, turning to face the commander.

&nbsp;

"Good. Continue to monitor all incoming channels, and get me the captains on tactical," Dubhlainn said, slipping an earpiece with a boom mic on.


As he issued orders to his captains, he watched the realtime tactical display. The unidentified contacts were obliquely moving towards his ships, which were stretching out into a gun line, with *Dyrnwyn* at the tip, and banking away from the contacts to maintain as much distance as possible. For a moment, he considered holding his course and closing into carronade range, but he wasn't going to risk his fast, lightly armored ships against an unknown enemy.

&nbsp;

"Sir," said a hesitant voice to his left. Looking over, he saw Augustus Singh looking up at him. "I've double checked the data I'm receiving, sir, and some of it is unclear, but if what I'm reading is correct, I have an ID on the largest ship, which gives us relative mass for the others, sir."

&nbsp;

"Well, what is it, Lieutenant?"

&nbsp;

"Sir, according to this, it's a Yamamoto-class Fleet Carrier, sir. SCNS *Admiral Halsey*," the shaken young man said, transmitting the update to the tac-tank. The '1' marker shimmered into 'Halsey', and the unassuming grey blip shifted into a red Fleet Carrior icon.

&nbsp;

Commodore O'Brian froze for a moment, heart pounding, staring at the icon.


"Check the data again. *Admiral Halsey* went missing over a century ago."

&nbsp;

"Sir, I have. I can't be one hundred percent certain, but it matches. I can confirm she's the right size, and running under power. I have the core running a visual comparison to archived footage of the Halsey now."

&nbsp;

"Fine," Dubhlainn said after a moments pause. "I believe you, Lieutenant, but keep that visual comparison running anyway. Based on *Halsey*'s known mass profile, what does that tell us about these other signatures?" He gestured to the other three signals, loosely grouped around the old fleet carrier.

&nbsp;

"Sir, by my best estimation, two frigates and a heavy cruiser, sir," Singh replied, highlighting the vessels as he spoke. "Nothing specific yet, but I'll work on that now, sir."

&nbsp;

"Good," said the commodore, leaning towards the tank, watching as the rest of the markers shifted to orange class markers, denoting suspected but unconfirmed identity. Looking down, he pulled the data on SCNS *Admiral Halsey* from the battlecruisers database, speed-reading armaments and equipage, as well as known weaknesses in the Yamamoto fleet carriers.


The intercom chimed at his elbow. He punched it without looking, re-reading the profile.
"Commodore, your sensor man is having a laugh at us, da? The information he sent down here says the big one is *Admiral Halsey*. That is impossible; ship has been dead for a century."

&nbsp;

"Missing in action for one hundred and seventeen years, Illarion. It looks like we found her, and she still isn't answering our hails," Dubhlainn said, quoting the number from the profile in front of him.

&nbsp;

"C," Illarion Korchenkov said, and the comm line went dead again.

&nbsp;

"Sir! She's launching," came the shout from the side, a petty officer in the sensor section. "Multiple squadrons out of *Halsey*, sir, they're headed this way!"

&nbsp;

O'Brian's head snapped up to the tac-tank, watching several squadron marks appear and start moving towards his ships. "Dubois! New message; Unidentified carrier, recall yer squadrons immediately, or this will be considered an act of aggression against the Solar Commonwealth and met with force!"
He flipped his tac-net headset back on.
"Shining Sword, prepare for strike craft. Marine units to repel boarders. *Dirk*, *Dagger*, stay in the wash until the last second, then come out shooting. All ships, redistribute scales to deflect incoming fire; *Halsey* mounted four driver turrets that became the pattern used for *Dyrnwyn's*, and we still don't know what those frigates or that cruiser have mounted." He muted his headset and turned to the sensor section on his own bridge. "Sensory! Alert me as soon as you detect energy plumes from those ships; I want to know if they start throwing things at us, and I want to know how big the things they're throwing are!"

&nbsp;

"Sir, those strike craft are still incoming," the petty officer reported.

&nbsp;

"Thank you, PO. Dubois, cease broadcast on all previous messages. New broadcast."

&nbsp;

"Ready, sir!"

&nbsp;

"Unidentified ships, with no context for your actions, I must assume you to be hostile to my battlegroup, and the Commonwealth. We will meet your attack with deadly force and will engage you in ship-to-ship combat unless you stand down your weapons and shields immediately." He cut across his neck savagely, and nodded to the lieutenant. "Send it." Dubhlainn reactivated the mic on his headset. "All ships, lock rail turrets on target designate UF1, repeat, Unidentified Frigate One. Fire on *Dyrnwyn*'s lead." He flipped the mic off and stabbed his intercom. "You get that, 'chenkov?"

&nbsp;

"Da, sir. Turrets VP1, 2, 3, and DP1, 2, and 3 all locked, commodore. Solid shot."

&nbsp;

"Good. Keep your sabots and hex rounds close though; we need to take these escorts down fast."

&nbsp;

"Da," came the reply before the link went dead again.

&nbsp;

O'Brian drummed his fingers along the railing beside the pulpit, watching the incoming strike craft on the tac-tank as his ships maneuvered into position to engage the other ships. A gun line three ships long, with *Dyrnwyn* in the front, followed by *Tyrfing*, and *Caladbolg* picking up the tail. *Mo Ye* and her sister *Gan Jiang* took up positions above the larger warships, while *Sharur* and *Kladenets* mirrored them beneath the line.
He took a deep breath, watching the closing fighters and his own ships slowly close on each other. His gaze rested on the icon marking the *Admiral Halsey*. He regretfully pressed the intercom button to gunnery.


"Commander Korchenkov," he said formally. His subordinate heard the tone and responded in kind.

&nbsp;

"Yes, commodore?"

&nbsp;

"Fire."
