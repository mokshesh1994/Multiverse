*[Heavy, ragged breathing]*

Holy shit, guys. I think I've found the answer to life and everything. I took notes, see, I've been keeping this notepad in my nightstand drawer so that I can jot down everything I remember when I wake up.

[*Paper crumpling*]

December 10, 2014 -- this was over a year ago. I woke up from this weird-ass dream. In it, I was suspended in a vat of liquid. At first, I panicked, and I struggled to breathe; that was before I realized that I actually didn't need to. Some sort of system keeps me oxygenated without actually having to breathe through my lungs. Weird though, I can't feel my extremities. Its as if I was paralyzed all over, and I could only move my eyes.

*[Page turning]*

Jan 24, 2015 -- same dream. This time I looked beyond the vat and saw lights of different colors, blinking. I could also somewhat hear some sounds, although they were muffled through the liquid. I thought I could discern some sort of human speech, but I can't really understand what they were saying.

Feb 5, March 12 -- the same dream all over again. Every fucking time I'd wake up with my heart pounding and I'm sweating like fuck. At first I shrugged it off from reading too much Reddit sci-fi pasta, but the dream just keeps recurring. I'm scared as shit to sleep by then.

*[Huffing sound, flame crackling, probably taking a drag from a cigarette; long exhale]*

April 16 -- I tried to move my head this time. Oh yeah, in the same dream. I could somewhat feel my neck but nothing down below. So I kept trying. And slowly I could manage a slight nod. I kept at it for a while and then I was almost able to do a neck-bow. That's when I saw it. Holy fucking shit. I didn't have a body. Below my neck there were a bunch of wires -- probably what's keeping me alive.

*[Another drag]*

May 20 -- Yeah, at this point you probably already know that it's the same dream. Okay. I tried to look around and get my bearings -- apparently my vat was tucked in some dimly lit corner, away from the most of the others. Oh yeah, there were other vats. A lot. Severed heads just like mine. And by my estimation it was a huge room, like a Walmart.

July 1 -- I almost didn't have a dream for a month. I got my hopes up. Anyway, this time I noticed *them*. Tall, silver, wispy things. They had the shape of a human, but they were ethereal. Heh, sounds too fucking crazy just hearing myself say it. They glided around as if checking from vat to vat. One came near mine, so I shut my eyes and pretended to be 'asleep'. Yeah -- all the heads in the other vats seemed to be sleeping.

August 13, September 5 -- nothing to report. Same routine. But fuck it, I'm in the dream much longer this time. Keeps getting longer every time, too. The speech I thought I heard in the previous dreams seemed to come from the wispy humanoids.

October 12 -- I saw the head beside my vat wake up. It looked panicked. The wisps seem to have noticed and they approached it. I couldn't understand their language but I instinctively knew that they were gonna 'kill' it. They shut down its system and I saw the head struggle for breath. It was gruesome. Guess what? Next morning when I woke up, my distant cousin Yoanna died in her sleep. They chalked it off to heart attack. And when I come to think of it, they look alike. Weird. And creepy as fuck.

*[Chair dragging; footsteps; chair dragging; gulping sound]*

Ahh, okay. *[Exhale]* I haven't slept for days now. I've been keeping myself awake with a lot of Red Bull and online games. I'll probably die soon, but I'd have that over sleep and going back there. November 21 -- I didn't notice a wisp materialize right beside my vat, and it must have caught me 'awake'. It 'stared' at me for a while -- I assume it was staring because as far as I can tell it had no eyes -- but I feigned sleep and I felt it move away.

*[Drag; exhale]*

I also noticed a pattern of 'deaths'. It seems to happen to one on my row, and then a one in front of mine. Here's the shitty part -- by my calculations, I'm up next. And thus I can't sleep. I'm pretty fucking sure that next time I sleep, it'd be me.

I don't want to die.

Help me please.

Any moment now, it'd be me.

*[Click; silence]*

*[Continuous silence for 15:02 minutes]*

*[Can falling to the floor; probably of a beverage]*

*[Snoring]*

*[Choking sound; gasping for air]*

*[Guttural bubbling sound]*

*[Thud; large object to the floor]*
