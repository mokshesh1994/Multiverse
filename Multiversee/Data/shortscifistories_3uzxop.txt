Moonlight People

We all felt terrified. The Emergency Alert System suddenly took over, and it was hair-raising to hear the warning tone blast out of the speakers over and over.

*The following is broadcasted at the request of the National Meteorological Service. Please stay indoors and avoid looking outside. Lock your doors and draw your curtains.*

Panicked, mom ran to the windows and pulled the curtains down. Dad rushed to the door and locked the deadbolts. I stayed exactly where I am, frozen.

And then it played again. This time, it was a bit different. Just as before, the warning tone blared loudly but it sounded just slightly off: instead of being flat, it sounded distorted, like a dirty VCR tape.

*follow* -- **silence** -- *look* -- **silence** -- *outside.*

Even the voice sounded different. It sounded like a child. And then, the voice started counting. But it wasn't in progression, it was as if numbers were being said at random.

*5. 2. 15. 3. 6. 21. 12. 5.*

And then a blinding flash of light, and a shockwave. When I regained my vision, I saw them: they looked just like us, except that their faces were featureless. No nose, no mouth. Not even eyes. Just a pale blank slab. But they were wearing mom and dad's clothes.

And then darkness.

And then I woke the following morning, tucked in my bed. I heard mom come up the stairs, and she opened my door. With a blank expression on her face, she said: "Good morning, daughter. Time to get ready."
