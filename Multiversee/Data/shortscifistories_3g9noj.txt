My Time with the 3rd Expeditionary Corps
almenslv
Standing on Earth as a child, I loved to look up at the stars, the innumerable stars that surrounded me.  No matter where I went, there they were.  Their overwhelming volume filled me with a sense of grandiose community and an ambitious fervor.  I will see them all.

So I enlisted in the 3rd expeditionary corps to set out into hyperspace and do just that.  On our trip I saw so many similar skies with untold numbers of stars each and I grew thirstier.  When, finally, we penetrated into the core of the galaxy, we landed on a planet whose night sky was the densest wall of light I have seen.  The stars were so many and so close not only to each other but also to me that it moved me to tears.

We moved on with hardened vigor, crossing over to the spiral arm most opposite our home.  As we moved out from the core, the skies grew lighter and sparser until Terminus.

The outmost star system on the furthest tip of a spiral arm.  There I stood under night sky and felt the verge of intergalactic space.  One half of the sky, aimed inward to the galactic core, was lit with a view of stars.  The other half was stripped of light.  Looking out into that half sunk my guts like peering over the edge of a skyscraper.  I felt sudden instability as I watched the void, not interstellar void, which seemed cozy by comparison, but intergalactic void.  All at once the instability of my gut tipped and I felt the smallness of the Milkyway and of the corps mission.  We had disembarked on some 322 planets: atoms of a molecule of a drop of water in an infinite ocean.  

When I returned home to retire, I took to stargazing again.  Except this time, instead of seeing the inspiring infinity I was used to, I was daunted by its finiteness.
