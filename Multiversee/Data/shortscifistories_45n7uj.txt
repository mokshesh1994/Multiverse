The Jewel.
Above_The_trees
This city was magnificent once, a bustling centre where the rich and famous would visit for a weekend away. A place where people could feel safe and enjoy the luxuries life had to offer. It was a sea of beautiful deep red once night fell, truly a sight to behold. Now? Its falling down piece by piece.

I remember the guys down in the lab telling me that if we went forward with the trials then we would be creating something bigger than us. Something better than man, they said. And I forced their hand. I made them create it. 

See thats the problem with technology. We think we can control it but, its become so much more than that now. 

Bionics, they call them. They started off as part human in the labs, now theyre anything but. Ripping the city down and killing innocents. They were programmed to do the complete opposite. From up here I've seen first-hand that they are almost indestructible. The city will be sealed at midnight and future generations will be told of the bionics and what they did.

I wonder everyday if the city will ever become the jewel it once was.

Sir, are you ready to leave? Theyve made their way to the 5th floor and are approaching fast. 

Yes, Im ready to leave.

Playing God was a mistake. I'm not ashamed, what we've done here has changed the world as we know it forever. 

Weve made history, gentlemen.
