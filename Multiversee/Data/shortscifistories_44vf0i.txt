Murphy felt the pain as the micro-organic bullet entered his skin, severing the neural connections and instantly paralysing the tissue. His Mars Police Facility body armour didn't protect him from such a weak bullet. Ironically.

 His artificial hand responded to the shocking impulse by instantly getting loose and severing any connections to the brain. A micro-org could be lethal, should it get to the brain. Sadly. Yet he was alive and well, thanks to the swiftness of the programme.

 Suddenly, his pistol erupted, engulfing his normal hand in flames and plasma. ''Oh. I didn't know they had swivel-lets. I wish we had equipment for that.'', he thought.

 He was dead a second later.
