[mini] On Loop

You are an astronaut on a solo mission to Mars.

You come-to in your ship and can't remember what's happening or what went wrong.  Most of your instruments are offline.

Checking the radio you hear a faint scratchy message playing on loop, "Ground control to Major Tom. We are playing this message on repeat in a continued effort to contact you. The frequency 1 number higher than this is being monitored for your reply. Please respond and we will receive an alarm and get back to you in person."

You send back a cautious reply, not necessarily making them aware of your own confusion about the situation.  Then you begin to feel a bit light-headed and decide that you ought to log this interaction in your notebook just in case you pass out again and can't remember having done it.

You grab the notebook and immediately notice that it must have gotten damp because instead of looking new and compact, every page looks puffy and separated. You turn to the first couple pages and find them full already, with your own handwriting.

In fact, every page of the entire notebook, 200 sheets, front and back, are completely full.

"What day is it?" you wonder, your head swimming, as you pass out again.
