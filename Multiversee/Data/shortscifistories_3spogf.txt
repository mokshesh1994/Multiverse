Closed Loop
buddhistmonk0
All I had to do was turn the machine on and myself from the future would step out. Then I would wait a few minutes, get inside the machine, and the machine would send me back to when I turned it on to meet my past self. A closed loop of causality. The first successful travel through time. But imagine my surprise when I turned on the machine and the only thing to flutter out of it was a note, in my own handwriting, which read ''*turn it off*'.
