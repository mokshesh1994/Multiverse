Captain Nevar returns! After weeks of mystery and the darkness of writer's block our hero is back. Still in control of Mars, but faced with a united humanity and weapons beyond comprehension how will our magical muse react? Can he hold himself and his crew together in the face of overwhelming odds? And what of the rest of Elewena? How will the fierce First Mate find her place in the chaos? Finally, what of the captured human Governor Kameko? Find out in today's installment of "They Have No Spark!"

___________________________________________________

I realized early on in my life something that many never fully understand. Madness is contagious. Governor Kameko had come aboard my ship and she had brought the madness with her. The madness that humanity had united, a ridiculous probability brought into reality through the intervention of an impossible variable, namely my dumb ass. Incredulous and disbelieving she had laughed with the uncontained joy of providence found, of prayers answered. With her words the virus had travelled to me, it pulled at my lips and unprepared muscles of my face. My lips curved up into a smile a little too wide and my eyes lit with a dangerous, unjustified brightness. 

My mission was impossible. I had known that it would be difficult from the beginning and the longer we had stayed in this sparkless solar system my chances had drifted towards would require intervention from a benign god. I had attempted to hide it from my crew, to remain unceasingly inspiring and optimistic. Hell, I had conquered an entire world and now held in my hands the lives of a million people. But now I wore the expression of a man who has been defeated not through failing, but through the destinys own heedless machinations. The contagion of madness which Kameko had brought on my ship with her wild joy had infected me as soon as I heard the punchline of the mad cosmic joke the universe had played.

And so I stood on the bridge, stock straight, smiling, and listened to the madness. My feral grin had not left my face since I had realized the true ridiculousness of our situation. At first it had unnerved my crew, but as word spread around the ship of the utter improbable insanity of our situation I soon found every face in the crew became a mirror image of the one next to it. Disease moves quickly through a packed ship.  Short bursts of laughter echoed through the hallways as we let the hilarity of our fate break through the decorum of military service. Dark jokes spawned fits of laughter the length and volume of which would have alarmed any sane people. Elewena had made a valiant, if eventually failed, effort to stave off the sickness, but even she had succumbed. She had been far too close to patient zero to ever have any real hope of escape. The Blackbird had become an asylum, but there were no orderlies or doctors. The patients ran the show. Well to be exact, one patient, was really in charge, me. 

My plan was clear now that I had broken through the bindings of my sanity. I picked up the communication stone and opened it to all channels.

It should have been clear from the moment I met one of these humans. The first moment of clarity should have been enough to guide my path. They have no spark. The spark is the hallmark of life and sentience and everything that guides our morality. It is the sign of a soul. These animals that mime intelligence are nothing more than the galaxys most advanced beasts. For a while their mimicry had me fooled and it cost us. Many sparks have been extinguished. Our ships light is dimmed. These creatures speak as we do, they build as we do, and they kill as we do, but they are nothing like us. They are charlatans and frauds empty of the spark and the soul it gives us. It is time to put them in their proper place. They will submit or they will all burn. Each of the other species our noble race has encountered carried a spark. And each one of them recognized the superiority of the Eldars. In strength and complexity of magic we are unmatched. Our spark is superior. There is no sense resisting the inevitable, so each race surrendered and were welcomed into our bountiful empire. The defiance of humanity is an affront to the natural order the galaxy. The darkness of their bodies should put them at the lowest rung of our galaxys hierarchy. If they refuse to accept this position we will be forced to remove them entirely. Up until now we have been fighting as if these animals deserved the respect and care we would give to any being with a soul. Now we will fight a war of extermination, unleashing the greatest powers among us to rain devastation and death from our proper place in the heavens down upon their lowly heads until those heads bow or burn.

My smile spread wide as the ship echoed with the cheers of a crew given hope, purpose, and freedom. Freedom from the constraints of morality which had held back the true destructive potential of our magic. We could rain our judgment down on earth with fire and brimstone. They would relent or they would be exterminated.

*Elewena*


I closed the door to my quarters as quickly as I could without attracting attention. As I glanced into the mirror my mad mask quickly slipped from my face. My carefully manufactured facial expression disappeared and in its place I saw my natural emotions: horror, shock, fear. The Captain had lost it. He had just advocated xenocide. No, he hadnt just advocated it, he had reveled in the opportunity to commit xenocide. The flimsiness of his justification was obvious in my mind, but the ship had completely gone over to him. Faced with their sudden and inevitable death, morals had collapsed like a delicate house in front of a strong wind. I could not recognize the people I knew in the faces that surrounded me. For a second I paused. If everyone you met seemed crazy to you I felt the madness involuntarily pull at my lips and eyes. I shook myself forcefully. No, *I* wasnt the crazy one, I still knew what was right. 

This whole mission was a complete shit show. I had left with my heart full of pride for their glorious mission and with every hope of success. I had enjoyed the journey and the Captain, for all his jokes and disrespect for formality, he was actually highly intelligent, wickedly capable, good to his crew, and honestly charming in his own unique way. Then the first probe had been destroyed and they had met the humans. I had seen the danger immediately. Is there something I could have done right then and there or was it already too late? They were too different. They had no spark. To me this did not signal a lack of sentience, a lack of soul. To me this meant they were the first truly alien species the Empire had ever encountered. They were beyond the understanding. That which we cannot understand we fear. That which we fear we hate. That which we hate we demonize and trivialize, so we can destroy it. 

I sighed deeply and ran a svelte hand through my hair. My hand returned to my side and several hairs fell from it, loosened by the heavy stress of the past days. 

We had arrived in this system when it was teetering on the brink of self-immolation. Before we arrived the humans were like a ring of giants staring at each other, clubs at their sides each daring the other to make the first intimidating move. Then we had come along and deliberately kicked each giant as hard as we could under the loincloth (so to speak), stood back, and smiled devilishly. I paused and thought about that analogy again and let a half smile reach my lips. I really had been spending too much time with the crass Captain. I did not want this war. It would only end in the death of every single Eldar on this ship and likely millions of humans down on Earth. Freed of its moral constraints, magic could be horrifically powerful. This was especially true when you commanded an unchallenged position in the heavens above your enemy with a bloodthirsty crew and a mad genius for a Captain. Sure, eventually we would all be killed by a lucky human rocket or pilot, but in the meantime the Captain would direct asteroids on major cities, rain firestorms on enemy combatants, and would generally be the incarnation of Death. 

I wanted to study humanity, to understand it. They were unique and the most impossible, amazing thing I had ever encountered. An entire society built around technology that had traveled to space, built mega-cities, and developed creative and terrifying weapons for itself. If they had been soulless animals who had done this all on instinct and without thought that would be one thing, but they werent! I had seen it. I had seen the spark in their eyes which was a window to their soul. Even if I couldnt feel it with my own Spark, I knew it was there. While the Captain and much of the crew had been focused on the fighting, I had been delegated that administration. I had met these humans, spoke with them. And my wonder had increased. They laughed and they cried, they were jealous and forgiving, they hated and they loved. They needed a savior.

I slammed my fist on the wall. Pain refocused my mind on the problem I had to face. The Captain had been driven mad when faced with his own feeling of utter helplessness in the face of an impossible enemy. In contrast, when faced with an unacceptable, inevitable, imminent holocaust, I had found I could taste inspiration. It was a cold decision I came to. As I stared into the mirror and met my own ice-blue eyes I found myself afraid of my own reflection. 

I blinked quickly to push away the doubts and came to terms with my decision. I needed a gun and I needed to know how to use it.

*Kameko*


I had experienced a dramatic emotional shift since being returned to my cell. While my mind still soared at the possibility of a real and lasting future for humanity, I couldnt escape the selfish thoughts that led me to the belief that I would not be around to see it. How wickedly ironic. I, who fought tirelessly for union and cooperation between the belligerent nations of Earth now stood in one of the only places I could be where I could be sure I would be denied the opportunity to see my hope come to fruition. 

I was shaking my head once again wrapped in my very own, very proper, and very well-deserved pity party when I was snapped to awareness by the creak of my cell door opening. 

I did not expect this visit. I knew I was intelligent, a good politician, and had a knack for understanding and predicting the behavior of people. But this I did *not* see coming. The stoic sylvan woman who had stood calmly at the right hand of Captain Nevar walked softly into her cell along with the hapless translator, Fran. I felt surprise flit across my face and I internally cursed myself for the display of emotion. Despite my earlier breakdown, I knew I was very adept at portraying only the emotions I wished wanted others to see. This was the beginning of a very important conversation and I had already made a mistake. I needed to be at the top of my game. So I was proud when only five seconds later I managed to keep my face clear of revealing ticks as the woman carefully placed a pistol on the stone shelf of my cell. Internally however, I was freaking the fuck out. Was I going to be executed? That didnt make sense they would just twiddle their fingers and zip me into oblivion if thats what they wanted. Was I supposed to make a reach for it and *then* they would kill me and claim self-defense? Did the alien even know that thing was fucking weapon? I forced my eyes to shift away from the puzzling piece and back to the sharp blue eyes of the woman in front of me. I spared a glance for the translator who, yet again, seemed to wish she was anywhere else in the galaxy except the exact place she happened to be standing. 

Welcome to my humble abode. I would offer you refreshments, but unfortunately I am fresh out of wine and, actually, everything else too. If you kindly allowed me to make a quick stop off at my other residence on Mars I am sure I could provide you with something more appropriate.

I thought it was probably unwise to indulge in snide humor, but rationalized it to myself as brash confidence crafted to throw off the interloper. I needed to show I was not afraid of this woman. Which would be true if I overlooked my utter terror at the strong probability I had 30 seconds to live, tops. For all my cleverness, all I received in return was a casually raised eyebrow from the woman who stood before me after Fran had whispered the translation. I was again surprised by a short popping noise which preceded the entrance of a dark bottle in one hand and three small cups which the woman held casually in her hands.

Thats quite alright, I brought enough for all of us. She followed this brash statement with several more utilitarian motions that suddenly created quite a nice table setting and three wooden chairs. The woman practically collapsed into one of the chairs and motioned casually for Fran and me to join her. She then began the, at this point, predictable if still exceedingly inexplicable process of pouring each of us a glass of the dark liquid. I shared a glance with Fran which of mutual confusion and acceptance before each sitting in their proffered arrangement. The woman swirled the liquid in her glass once, brought it up to her lips and chugged it. From the expressions in Frans widened eyes, I could tell that this was not the normal method for consuming the liquid. However, the mysterious woman merely poured herself another cup and repeated the process. It was only on her third cup of the substance that she apparently decided to remember it was more of a sipping drink. As I raised my own cup, well aware that the substance could be pure poison to me, but utterly unable to care, I could smell just how much of a sipping drink it was. This was a very strong alcohol. I downed my first cup too; it burned pleasantly and profusely. However, I showed some restraint and control by not doing following my visitors example and being content with one shot, for now.  Fran sipped from her cup nervously. 

I suppose I should introduce myself. I am First Mate Elewena, second in command on this vessel. Oh, and I am also your best hope to save millions of humans from certain death. She paused there for a second to let that sink in. Took a sharp breath as if to stead herself and then began to talk very quickly. I believe the Captain of this ship has lost his ability to effectively lead and is planning on leading us all on a suicidal mission that will not only end in the deaths of everyone on this ship, but will almost certainly leave in its wake millions of innocent dead humans. He does not consider humans to be anything more than upstart, soulless animals and is therefore planning on tossing out all our normal rules of war. By which I mean he is definitely going to throw asteroids at earth and rain fire from the heavens until the humans are all dead, surrender, or manage to destroy this ship. In order to prevent this catastrophe I have determined I must stop Captain Nevar by any means necessary. I am well aware that although we share an affinity for the same type of magic, the Captain is stronger than me and I will not be able to defeat him in magical duel. Thus, the gun. She paused here to take a breath in. What I am doing may be considered mutiny and very probably will result in my immediate death. However, should I succeed in wresting control of the ship, I believe I can capably return the vessel and everyone on it to our home system and end this quixotic mission. Well, I am pretty sure. I have never actually flown the thing. We may end up in a sun or a black hole and all still die an unplanned, but painless and instantaneous death. I think I can avoid that  probably. In any case, I need you to teach me to shoot this damn thing so that I can incapacitate the Captain if he refuses to see reason Please. 

There was a slight delay between when her lips stopped moving and the words finished translating in my head. Then there was another delay while my brain tried to catch up and actually understand the meaning of what she had just said. I believed her. Moreover, if she succeeded I was fairly certain humanity would remain united. Their new enemy fleeing into the darkness would only inspire humanity to give chase. When it comes down to it humanity is a predator species. And when something we want runs away from us we cannot help ourselves, we have to run after it. Think of the explosion in technology that could occur from a unified humanity working in concert to chase its enemy through the heavens! 

 After what was probably an awkwardly long pause I looked up from my musings.

 Frans onboard with this? 

Fran answered for herself. I have spent much of my time talking to you and our other prisoner, Frank. I sensed an unexpected warmth when she mentioned Frank. I understand that you are worth saving. 

I nodded my approval. Good. Well then who am I to stop this suicide mission then, it sounds like once the Captain remembers I am here I will already be dead. My voice cracked slightly on that last word betraying a hint of my fear. I reached for the bottle in front of me, eschewed my now empty cup, and took a long pull of the dark liquid.

Let me show you how to work the safety

I apologize for the long delay, but it's back! With around twice the length of the previous chapters I hope this installment satisfies your appetite for a little while. Also, this is the penultimate chapter (dun dun DUN). So, prepare yourselves, we are nearing the end.
