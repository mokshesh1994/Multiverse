[Chapter 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3tsidv/runners_high_chapter_three/)

The first thing Kitt noticed about the light was the noise. Upon opening her eyes, she realized she lay on a bed inside an overly-lit room, surrounded by beeping machines. Although it was barely audible, it was both welcoming and painfully cacophonous at the same time.

&nbsp; 

*Looks like the surgery was successful.* 

&nbsp;

She grimaced against the sound as she felt yet another migraine coming on. In the three days since the fight with the Raili, Kitt had lived in a world as silent as space itself and plagued with frequent headaches.  Each day had been a struggle as she had begun to black out several times per day. Somehow she had limped into Orions port and set the auto pilot to dock before she passed out yet again.  

When she next awoke, she was in a hospital. It had been a miracle that she had survived. Massive cranial damage due to explosive decompression they had told her through various written communications. Several blood vessels had burst in her head, resulting in the blackouts. Her eardrums had also burst, rendering her deaf. They had immediately rushed her to emergency reconstructive surgery in order to restore the damage. 

&nbsp;

As she struggled to sit up, the door to the room opened and a doctor walked in, startling her. 

&nbsp; 

How are you feeling, Miss Kitano?

Kitt groaned. I can hear you, so thats good. Although my head still feels like Alderaan.


The doctor cocked his head. Im sorry. Feels like what?

Kitt smiled. Not many people these days had much of an appreciation for the classics Nothing, Doctor, just a bit of a headache still. 


The doctor reached up and twisted a valve in her IV. Thats easily fixed. Just need to adjust your dose. Your body is still recovering so youll need to take it easy, but it looks like youll be out of here in just a day or so. Until then, do you feel up to having any visitors?

Kitt nodded her head on reflex and then winced in pain. I think I can handle it.

&nbsp;

Thats good. A friend of yours is waiting outside. If you need anything, dont hesitate to call, okay?  With that, the doctor left the room.  A moment later, the door opened again and in walked a tall dark man in a suit with short black hair and wire frame glasses.  Howre you feeling, Helen Keller?

Kitt smiled. Youre not funny, Judie.

Jude stark greeted her with a gentle kiss on the cheek. Your head must still be split: its screwing with your memory. We both know Im hilarious.

Kitt smirked again. Your *face*, maybe.

&nbsp;

 Jude barked a laugh out loud, sending a jolt through Kitts head. Im sorry, the doc told me you were sensitive to sound. Im just glad to see youre alright. You had me really worried.  When they told me you had arrived unconscious, I assumed the worst. He reached out and took a hold of her hand and squeezed gently.

&nbsp;

Ive been in worse situations, Judie.

&nbsp;

Jude tightened his grip a little. Not under my employment, you havent. 

 Kitt grinned and squeezed Judes hand as hard as she could, which in her condition, wasnt much. As far as you know

Jude shook his head slowly. If I ever find that out, Ill kill you myself. Its bad enough that I have to worry about the ship that youre leasing. Speaking of which, your new ship is ready for you. All the upgrades you wanted all arrived as well. 
 
Kitt felt a pang of excitement. Really?! They said it would take months to get it in.

they've been installed and is ready to go. I assume you intend you use the money from your most recent job to finish off the payment, right?

The next one will be the last. I was able to secure a bounty while I was in Mars orbit that should pay quite nicely.

Jude nodded. Well, allow me to be the first to congratulate you, Captain Miyabi Kitano.

A thought crossed Kitts mind and she groaned. Ugh. Youre not going to start calling me Captain Kitt, are you?

Hmm. He said, thoughtful. It kind of has a nice ring to it, like an old kids cartoon, or a superhero. 

&nbsp; 

 He looked at his watch.  By the way, I have some intel on the xeno that you shot. It turns out that it is indeed Raili. Youve provided us more information for the war than has been collected within the last fifty years. Theres a guy coming here to give us a few more details who should be here any moment.

&nbsp; 


As if on cue, the door to the room opened.  The man who stumbled into the room in a flurry of apologies for bumping into the nurses in the hall was, to Kitt, the epitome of the word nerd.  He wore a blinding white lab coat that clashed with his sharply creased black pants and brown leather oxfords. His unruly blonde hair was kept barely in check by a hastily constructed ponytail, some of it coming loose and finding its way past thick blue eye glasses and into eyes that simply screamed science breakthrough of the century!  Kitt found herself wondering if a peek at his shirt pocket would reveal a pocket protector full of pens.

Jude stood and shook the scientists hand. Thanks for coming, Doctor Carter. 

He turned to Kitt. This is Doctor Alphonse Carter. Hes the resident Xenobiologist and the top expert on the Raili in the region.

Kitt extended a hand which Doctor Carter shook gently as Jude continued. Doctor Carter, this is Captain Miyabi Kitano. She is currently the first and only human to have successfully caught a living Raili.

Kitt narrowed her eyes at Judes inclusion of her new title but refrained from responding to it. Nice to meet you Doctor Carter. Just call me Kitt.

Al. he corrected. It truly is a pleasure. You are going to be a legend, Miss Kitt. To catch a live Raili is no simple feat.

Just Kitt is fine. What do you mean live? Im pretty sure I killed it. She thought about how the steaming body had floated across the room. 

Al shook his head. No. fortunately, it is still alive and is currently in containment. The Raili are very hardy. Where a plasma burst like the one you fired at it would normally destroy any-

Uh, six actuallyKitt said, cutting him off. 

&nbsp; 

Im sorry, what?

&nbsp;

Kitt crossed her arms impatiently. Six. I fired six plasma bursts at it.

&nbsp; 

Als already excitedly wide spectacled eyes grew into saucers. Six! It took six shots?! Neato! Well, this definitely makes the Raili far more impressive considering they themselves are actually quite frail. The creature you encountered wasnt actually the Raili itself. It was a biomechanical suit designed to traverse extreme environments and to keep it from having to deal with otherworldly pathogens. The actual Raili are much smaller creatures, snugly tucked away inside the suit.

Jude cocked his head to one side. Wasnt there an old movie from like a couple hundred years ago like that where these aliens in biosuits showed up and destroyed everything? Then they got beat by a computer virus?

Kitt nodded I remember seeing that movie in history class. Will Smith, right? We were doing a study on how humans viewed first contact. She grinned and stared at Al.  I also seem to remember the movie having a very excitable biologist that worked in Area 51.

&nbsp; 

Al thought for a moment. Hmmmovie where aliens in biosuitscomputer virus Will Smith Area fiftyOh! Oh! Yes! He began to hop up and down while clapping his hands like a toddler. Independence Day! Yes! Yesyesyes! Thats it! Thats exactly how the Raili are! Yes! Although Im nothing like the biologist in that movie.

&nbsp; 

Kitt watched him bounce around, raised an eyebrow and considered telling him just how well he matched the character, but decided against it.  Anyway, you were saying about the suits?

Al settled down a bit. Ah, yes. So where a plasma burst would fry a normal creature, it seems that the Raili suits are made to scatter the energy very efficiently. As such, even though the suit itself was essentially cooked, the Raili inside was simply stunned for a time and then imprisoned inside the suit until it was brought here and placed in containment.

&nbsp; 
   
So let me get this straight, I hit that thing six times with a plasma rifle and its only stunned? What about the cloak?

The cloak was damaged just a little. It is not part of the suit itself but is worn on the head, arms and shins. It should be repairable.

Good. Give it to me.

&nbsp; 

Al frantically waved both his hands in front of himself. That cloak is decades ahead of our own technology! I cant just hand that over!


Kitt waved her own hand dismissively.   I took it down. Its an enemy of humanity, a fugitive. Interstellar law states that the personal effects of a fugitive may be claimed by a bounty hunter when the fugitive is apprehended. That cloak rightfully belongs to me. You can scan it and do whatever research you need to in order to understand the technology while Im here. But when I leave, it and all other items with it come with me. As for the Raili itself, Id rather see it dead for what theyve done, but you can have it. Id say its a pretty good deal. I get the loot, you get one that knows how to make the loot.

&nbsp; 


Al nodded slowly, clearly disappointed. Well, when you put it like that, Id say it makes sense. I will have the Railis possessions delivered to you.  Anyway, I must be getting back to the lab. It had truly been a pleasure to meet you, Miss Kitano.  See you around Mister Stark. He turned and headed for the door. 

Jude waved back. Well be in touch.

&nbsp; 

As the door clicked shut, Kitt let out an exasperated sigh. Well that was interesting. He seems like quite a character.

Jude laughed. He is a bit high strung at times, but hes one of the most reliable and trustworthy guys Ive ever met.

Hes a geek. Kitt countered. He said Neato. No one has used the word neato in like two hundred years

&nbsp;

Jude nodded thoughtfully, as if remembering something. Maybe so, but when shit hits the fan, hes someone you want in your corner. So, now that we can talk in private, how is your search going?

Kitt shrugged. The guy on Luna told me that he didnt know his name, but that he was an engineer and that he had come to Luna from here at Orion.

Hmm, if thats the case, you may want to speak to the guys that work in the Core. I should be able to get you in there for a short visit.

The Core was DST Orions central power area. It housed pretty much everything that made the station function and access to it was highly restricted.  

&nbsp; 

His face softened in concern. Honestly Kitt, I know that this search is very important to you, but I God, how do I say this without sounding like an ass?

I know, Judie. Still, I need to find out what happened. Kitt looked at her wrists, usually concealed by long sleeves, now bare and bearing a long scar on each running up several inches. They were scars that had come from injuries that she had no memory of. 

&nbsp; 

I really think theres a connection between him and these. The memories of the last few years wont come back, but I have to find something

&nbsp; 

Just be careful. Whoever this guy is, if he has something to do with your scars, I dont trust him.

&nbsp; 

Thanks. As soon as Im out of here, Ill go check it out. Then Ill see if I can figure out why it was so important to deliver a live Raili to Deneb

Jude shook his head. nuh uh. I want you to take some time and rest, for the next week in fact.

but-

No. No fighting bad guys, No chasing leads, No bounty hunting. Rest. Go have some fun. See a movie or something. Go on a date. No work. Youre on paid vacation for the next week.

Kitt huffed. You know that Im likely to go crazy from boredom, right?

Thats why you have to get out and do things, you sociopath. Tell you what, when youre up to it, I know a great place only a few hours from here that-


Is this what you meant by go on a date? You gotta be more subtle than that, my friend.


Jude let out an exasperated sigh. I wont confirm or deny that, but my offer stands.


Kitt tried to give her best coquettish grin. Ill think about it.


Jude stood up. I need to go take care of a few things for today. Ill visit you tomorrow and well go take a tour of your new ship, okay?


Kitt slowly nodded, a warm edge of something happy fluttering up from within, despite all that had happened over the last few days. Deep down she knew that it had little to do with her new ship. 


Jude leaned close and kissed her forehead before turning to leave.  See ya tomorrow Kitten. 


As the door closed behind him, Kitt lay back and sighed. The warm fluttering in her chest began to work its way upward and soon revealed itself in a shy smile.
