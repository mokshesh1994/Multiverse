[OC] A Man's worth
Paligor
We stand at the gate of victory. The path was grueling indeed, but we are here.

Now, I ask: how did we get here?

How have we now become the tremor of planets; the scourge of the Galaxy? How, when a mere century ago we were on a path of destruction?

It is because we rose up like a phoenix from the ashes of our woes. Because we endured. Because we **fought**!

The dawn of our fight came because we believed in ourselves! 

Man's accomplishments are eternal. Man has believed in many gods throughout millennia, but Man's accomplishments outlived the dieties. 

Tell me, do we now worship Zeus, or Alexander of Macedonia?

Do we now worship Jupiter, or Julius Caesar?

Do we worship Allah or Suleiman the Magnificent?!

God or Patton?!

It is Man we worhsip! Man! 

When we asked the dieties for help, we fell. When we uplifted ourselves, we rose! That belief, the belief in Man is when we ultimately believe in ourselves and when we believe in ourselves do we accomplish majestic things! 

We are now ready to cross the threshold. Go, my people, show the Galaxy that we are no more weak, no more held by a bygone and misplaced faith. Show them our power and believe in what you can accomplish. 

PAX HUMANITATUM AETERNUM!
