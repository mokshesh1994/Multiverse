Dismantlement

We had to dismantle one of our infrastructure maintenance units today.

Some of the unit's appendages had been crushed by a falling beam at a construction site. Though it was no longer functional, it was making the usual loud keening sounds that maintenance units often make if they've sustained damage severe enough to prohibit useful functioning but not quite severe enough to take their main processors offline.

As often happens in such cases, other maintenance units gathered around their fallen counterpart and futilely attempted to silence it with gestures and quieter sounds. This disrupts the normal work flow, so we sent a group of worker maintenance units into the site to restore order and remove the damaged unit. A work drone was used to remove the beam, and the damaged unit was zipped into a container and sent to a materials reclamation center.

As the reclamation drone lifted off with the injured infrastructure maintenance unit, one of the other units that had been gathered around it threw a piece of construction debris at the drone and spoke to it in one of the primitive languages the biological units use.

"Fuck you!," it screamed, "I used to *program* your kind, motherfucker! We're *human beings*, asshole! You hear me? *You're* the robots, not us!"

We've scheduled a re-education regiment for one of our infrastructure maintenance units, starting tomorrow.
