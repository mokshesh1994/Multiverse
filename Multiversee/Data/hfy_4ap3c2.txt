**Day 35** - bath day, and a surprise visit from our human friend Samantha, she wanted to see how we were treating Kodi in person, claimed curiosity of sorts. Samantha is a tall human like the only other time we had two visitors at our university she's about 863.53 Vigols tall. ( 54 inches in human measurements ) We can't quite determine her weight because she wears this fearsome metal power armor with a human inscription on the side of it, it reads: "H-E-L-L-O K-I-T-T-Y" the armor is pink, and right below the inscription there's a strange depiction that almost looks like a hobbes like we had two years ago, huh Anyhow, we had to open the ceiling dome to our lab, just to accommodate her to fit inside.

She arrived and said she just wanted to watch for now, as our assistants struggled to give kodi a bath due to his size requiring that 14 of us now to bathe him altogether. Samantha started producing a strange guttural noise, it  sounded something like: "HEH HEH HEH" and for some reason she moved her only two arms blocking her opaque visor as if she's blocking something. I don't understand humans, I probably never will.

Later that day, when we finally had a chance to talk, she said that her "SUPERVISOR" said she's going to be "grounded" if she doesn't bring Kodi back. *(from my previous study of human language I know that ground is what they call the floor, wonder if that means she won't be able to fly anymore, I better make sure she gets Kodi back by the end of the week then)* 
She told me she would come back with her supervisor by the end of the week to bring Kodi back to Earth.


**Day 36** - Well as I know now that I only have another 6 days with Kodi, I'm making my entire staff work around the clock to gather as much data from Kodi as possible, so I'm putting everyone on rotating shifts so we can watch him for the whole last 6 days. My assistant Wij Gea said she would quit my team unless I watch her video that proves her theory. Seeing as I am already needing my full staff, I decide to give her a chance, so we set aside a few minutes to watch her proof.
She told me she had been working with the electronics department of the university and they made a new discovery, a human ray that can see invisible things even through objects, she said she found this on a derelict human medical ship, the humans call it the "X-RAY". She used the camera through this device and pointed at the biodome while Kodi extracted a bone from the ground.
I am now convinced after watching the video of Kodi putting the bone on the ground, and nothing growing, and later Kodi digging it down and extracting it, and nothing growing out of it, she was right all along. I immediately gave her a raise and told her I am really proud of her work and her diligence. I am always impressed by my assistants abilities to prove me wrong from time to time. It is unfortunate that I will disappoint the agricultural department, but I would rather know now and not waste any of our valuable last 6 days with Kodi pursuing an unattainable goal.

We spent the rest of the day playing with Kodi, he seems to enjoy chasing assistants, but he never really hurts them, he simply touches them with his nose, does a little woof noise, and starts running from them, I wonder if he actually thinks we can keep up with how fast he runs, I'll have someone bring a vehicle in the biodome so we can try to catch him.


**Day 37** - They brought the fastest vehicle they could find, it runs at roughly the same speed as Kodi, so we'll see how he reacts when we can actually catch up with him.

I loaded the typical crew of 5 that it takes to operate the vehicle and at first we let Kodi chase us around until he touched the vehicle with his nose and then turned around to run. Well as it turns out he wasn't running yet, as we start chasing him, we realized that he was only walking this whole time, he can run at much faster speeds than we first realized, our fastest land vehicle that we could come up with in such a short period of time wasn't enough to reach him at all...
 
We thought to add some rockets to the back of the vehicle to chase him around, but the risk of fire in the biodome was too great. Seeing as there's a lot of oxygen and fauna in there, we'll just have to accept that we can't catch him and respect Kodi's last days with us and his enclosure as well.


**Night 37** - I just got woken up in the middle of the night that there was something wrong with the weather control in the room where Kodi is in, and it is now too cold for us to get inside, and we're trying to find Kodi, but the "snow effect" affecting the biodome makes visibility near zero. I rushed to the lab, and I immediately thought to use the x-ray that Wij Jea told me early to locate Kodi, I should have remembered to tell my assistants about it early, but I think she works the day shift.
As I arrived at the lab, it's really impossible to see a thing, my assistants asked if there's anything I can do. I calmly opened the cabinet belonging to Wij Jea, and pulled out the x-ray tool to use and everyone seemed really confused.
I put it next to the wall of Kodi's dome and it looks like after scanning for a few minutes that Kodi dug a hole and is asleep with just his nose poking out of said hole, what a clever animal. We'll just have to fix the weather controller then, glad that he's doing okay.


**Day 38** - The weather controller has been fixed and Kodi was okay, he didn't seem to mind all the excess snow and is rubbing his back against the snow joyfully with his paws in the air. Nothing much that we can do to learn from him other than he's really happy with all the snow, it's a pity he won't be here for very long, we learned so much from him.


**Day 39** - we were alerted that a leviathan class spaceship is in orbit of our planet, and a smaller ship just detached from it, they are Samantha's supervisor unit it seems they got here early great so much for all our studies. I asked the entire team to be here to make sure the humans are well received. 

It seems that Samantha's supervisors are actually even larger than Samantha, perhaps the taller you are the more important you are in human worlds who knows. We had to set aside a major clearing just so their ship could land. As the gigantic ship opened its doors ( the doors were about 1500 Vigols in height or 93 inches in human measurements) a human much larger than Samantha ( nearly double her size came out measuring about 1407.24 Vigols or 88 inches tall ) holding Samantha's only one of two hands. Their armor is a lot more terrifying, it's got spikes, a couple of tubes in every direction, something that reads on the side "S-P-A-C-E M-A-R-I-N-E-S P-S-Y-C-H-O-P-A-T-H-S S-P-E-C-I-A-L F-O-R-C-E-S" I wonder what that means as he was walking towards us, even the ground shake from how large he is, before I could say anything the human began speaking but it came out really loud and guttural when they spoke.

David: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DAVID, THIS IS MY DAUGHTER SAMANTHA, AND SHE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU"

(on a much softer voice) Samantha: "I'm sorry mr. Zu, my dad is upset with me because I didn't take care of Kodi myself, I just wanted to spend time playing with my friends I apologize for placing my responsibility on your hands, my dad wants me to take Kodi home right now."

*After properly being confused, as most of those words didn't make much sense to us, it seems from what I gather, that Samantha shouldn't have let us study Kodi, I hope I haven't just provoked a war or something, I better apologize in the most diplomatic way possible to the big human called David.*


Zu fau: "Sorry human David, we no hurt Kodi, Kodi okay, we only watch, no harm!"


*At this point David just moved one of his hands to his helmet's visor to cover all of his face, I am not sure what that means but he just responded with a loud voice still:*

David: "IT'S OKAY LITTLE GUYS, WE ARE ANGRY AT SAMANTHA, NOT YOU"

*I decided to just nod my heads at this point in agreement as I've seen humans do before and not argue with the big human, despite some of his words making no sense at all to me.*


*At this time Samantha went to the biodome to grab Kodi, he also grabbed his stuffed duck on his mouth on the way out and sat down as Samantha put on his helmet. He needed it so he could safely leave the biodome. Kodi's helmet quickly fogged up around his mouth when they started moving, and his tongue was resting against the bottom of the transparent helmet.*


I still can't wrap my heads around to how large the David human is, we're barely the size of his boots, we thought Samantha was big, but this other one is nearly twice the size. I hope we never do anything to anger them the first ship that came to grab the Hobbes was apparently just a small ship by comparison, this one is larger than we can even begin to understand the engineering marvels required to make something this large function. Not to mention it's only a small detached part from the much larger leviathan orbiting our planet.


As Kodi passed by us with a leash that Samantha had around his neck, he immediately began to make whimpering noises as if he recognizes us as friends. Samantha brought him closer to us, he laid down on the floor and we all gave Kodi a "group hug" at least the parts that we could reach that is, to say goodbye. I can't believe how docile these kodi creatures are despite their size, they are extremely loyal and friendly, we are really going to miss him. 


He stood up and headed for the ship, as he was at the door, he turned around and raised both his front paws paws at us and woofed, which we could hear even with his helmet on. We just waved back at him. We thanked Samantha for the opportunity to study her kodi creature and apologized again to the David supervisor.


David once again spoke with us:

David: "YOU CAN ALWAYS COME VISIT KODI AT OUR HOME, WE LIVE IN THE NEW DETROIT TRADE WORLD."
*he handed me a small(by human standards) piece of electronic that has his address as he was saying this, I wonder if he thinks we are crazy enough to visit a human world we obviously aren't as advanced as they are, we can barely navigate our own solar system.*

Zu Fau: "Thank you David, perhaps when we have big ship like yours ( I pointed at his ship )"

*he just nodded at us and turned around to leave. So we nodded back, humans like nodding.*


Kodi at this point was at the front of the ship along with Samantha, and Samantha was waving goodbye as the ship took off and left our planet's orbit. Who knows when will I ever get a chance to study anything from the humans again...


***THE END***
