[mini] First Contact
anakthal
Humanity had been spread thin for a long time, crossing the dark void between galaxies. Now home was drawing near, so she shook of her long sleep, and gathered her tendrils. A vast aquatic god, slowly rising up from the depths, she washed up against the outer edges of the Oort cloud, and then glided past them. Once she could have enveloped all, now she had purpose once more.

Her most curious front reached the inner system first, rushing in like a first breath, past scorched planets and splintered remnants of moons. On spectra no biological eyes could see, humanity glittered like a cloud of mirror dust, caught in the last reincarnation of Sol. Consciousness coalesced as all the extended machinery of thought grew dense and close enough to cross that threshold of computations-per-picosecond.

Humanity opened her minds-eye.
  

&nbsp;


The solar-system had been changed almost beyond recognition by the death-throes of Sol's previous cycle, but Earth stood where she had left her. Cocooned in the glowing fields of v-generators, tombstones for a birth-world. It had not reverted to its burning and molten planes of origin, nor to the barren and icy fields that had marked its end. Earth was still green and blue.

She felt pleased.


&nbsp;


Humanities mind thawed further, accelerating the speed of thought, pushing against the barriers that she herself had put there the last time. She had arrived in full, all fronts now collected in orbit around Earth. Slowly she began her ritual, the pilgrimage growing to its climax. Contact was established with the ancient protocols, out-dated handshakes and threat-assessments, a colourful formality. The silent watchers she had put here so long ago could not have resisted a trillionth of her, let alone her full presence. Finally the gate-way opened and information flowed clear like a spring brook up from the once-more green planet. All the years that had gone by, recorded in the smallest detail, the sway of every leaf and the shape of every cloud, played back now like an impossible memory. Humanity carefully dipped a finger and pushed in, against the current, with the smallest bit of herself. Every sparkle of thought, every thread of mind, and every semi-aspect of existence focussed now onto this singular touch. And she wept.


&nbsp;


Humanity had come to pay its respect. She had come to grieve her old cradle and to celebrate that it had not become her grave, as she had done every million years, for longer than she could admit to remember. She wrapped herself around this long-lost world, and remembered again why, in shedding all she had ever been, she had kept her consciousness all this time. In a universe of simple laws, the culmination of true evolution was always a singular entity, a race organism, a solitary intelligence. And through the seas of time and space, such travellers would always pass each other by unnoticed, save for perhaps the foam on the stirred waves, or the hint of a distant lantern fading into the mists. Being was a lonely affair, and sadness an unimaginable gift. Humanities embrace softened as she carefully started pulling back, letting her touch linger for as long as she could.


&nbsp;


And then something touched back.


&nbsp;


It slipped, cool and smooth, between her fingers. It danced around her edges, and when she tried to reach for it, ever-so-gentle, it escaped her grasp playfully. Nothing like this had ever happened. And Humanity was exhilarated. She rejoiced and poured herself into the atmosphere, ignoring the flashing tombstones and the screaming alarms, sweeping them aside without a notice. The air rushed passed her, filled with sounds and sights that should not be. She tasted spectra so quaint yet so fresh that she could not but revel in their presence. Finally, when all of her that would fit was there. She collected herself and for what seemed like an eternity thought every thought possible, looked back and forth through time and found but one option.


&nbsp;


Humanity said hello. And a million new voices answered her.
