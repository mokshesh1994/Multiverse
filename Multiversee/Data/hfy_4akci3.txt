Persistence Hunting

A/N: Just a little thingy I drew up in the comments section of a WritingPrompts post to try and explain persistence hunting. Got a tad carried away and figured it would probably fit here. EDIT: Huh, more upvotes than I was expecting, neat.

For those of you who don't quite know what persistence hunting is, here's a description.

Imagine if you will that you're an antelope. Grazing, generally minding your own business while keeping your senses peeled for predators.

Then you catch a faint whiff of something distinctly non-antelope.

Your head pops up, you look around, listen carefully, and spy the loud biped in the grass 100 meters away. Then it starts moving towards you.

Alarm spikes through your veins as you do what your kind have been built to do for millions of years, you flee. Sprinting away from the smelly, toothy, **threat** in the grass. You move faster than it could ever hope to chase, and you leave it behind. After a few frantic minutes of flight you've lost sight of it. Heart pounding, lungs burning, and core overheated you stop your gallop, open your mouth, and begin *blessed* panting, slowly lowering your body temperature back to something approaching tolerable levels.

But you will have no respite today.  
For not long after you stop you catch a scent, a wisp of movement, or rustle of grass on the edge of your awareness and you're up and alert once again. Scanning for threats you again spy the ape-thing in the distance, still, impossibly, moving towards you. You freeze, in hopes that it hasn't seen you, but as it closes to within a few dozen meters it's intent is clear. You are tired and hot now, the burning noon-day sun not helping in the least, but if you do not move, you will die. So once again, you flee.

Sprinting. Galloping. Trying desperately to get away.

The day continues like this, one long hell of exertion, broken by those all-too-brief minutes of respite when those fur-less **things** are out of sight. It continues for what feels like hours...

Until you can run no more.

Nauseous and worse from heat exhaustion you hear it coming through the grass. It's feet pounding that steady cadence you've learned to fear into the dirt. You try to muster one more sprint, one more flight, but your limbs betray you and it's all you can do to lie there on the ground and try vainly to pant the heat away. 

Half mad-with fear and too hot to think you scrabble weakly at the ground as it comes into view, picks up a rock and closes those final few meters.

It raises it's stone to the sky, and, with a flash of pain, everything turns black.

Behold the Human. They do not have to be stronger than you or faster than you to kill you, they do not need sharper claws or more potent venom. They simply need to *outlast* you. To take one glance at the tracks, piss, and shit that you leave behind and *know* where you are.  
Then they just have to follow you until your body gives up and dies.

We are Human, and we are *terrifying*.
