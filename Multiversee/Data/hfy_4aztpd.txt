**M.Y. 2154**

The morning light of the primary star, Alpha Centauri A, bounced off of Santiago's face plate, the bright yellow star casting long shadows over the ruins of the fort's surface compound. The habitat dome had been the first to be destroyed by the Gaians, the old web of cables and fabric now blanketing the compound in tatters. Sticking out were the old buildings, firm stone scorched and chipped by laser fire. Santiago inspected the ground at her feet, an old parade ground now covered with rubble. The 200,000-strong population now lived underground, an ant colony of concrete and steel that ensured to her that the Cult of Skye would bleed for this ground.

They had to, the Colonel concluded. Fort Legion commanded the North-East strip of land dividing the Freshwater Sea from the Sea of Pholus. To the North, Gaian colonies, mad places of barbarism that practiced superstitious dogma and indulged decadent vices. To the South, Spartan farmland, cleared of xenofungus and fed by the rivers running into the Freshwater Sea from the heights of Mount Leonidas, a project of discipline and hard work that turned a stretch of alien hell into the breadbasket of humanity's last hope.

And Skye would destroy it all to please her gods.

Santiago turned her back on the Morning Primary and faced the North-West perimeter. Her troops, clad in exosuits, were moving the bodies of those who fell in their duty, and clearing and repairing damage to their entrenchments. It had been only a few hours since the latest attack from the Gaians, which like all the others before it, ended in failure. The Surface Operating Base had always been a calculated display of activity, lifetimes of training distilling what in inferior armies would be ill-led rushes to hobble together a decent enough defence for the next wave into ordered, sensible routines of movement with the precision of a watch. Softer societies would describe it as a dance. She cracked a smile.

*Conscience is but a word that cowards use,*

*Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe:*

*Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.*

*March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell;*

*If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.*

Her feet felt the trembling ground, and through her suit and 200 metres of alien air, the roar of great guns reached her ears. The impact artillery, the greatest works of the forges of Blast Rifle Crag, had their place in the old naval academy campus, bombarding the Gaian positions so that they didn't get any foolish ideas. At least, none that they hadn't already developed after two years of war and six months of this futile siege.

In truth, Santiago had always been familiar with foolish ideas, as intolerant as a life on the streets had made her of them. From as early as her selection for the Unity Project, she could trace the foolish ideas, and the heads whom they occupied, that had brought her to this detestable waste of time and ammunition that the Gaians referred to as a 'vendetta'. The position of captain on that wretched starship was always a political one. The Americans wanted an American in charge, and since they had the money and the Orion Drive, they got one. They couldn't put a military officer in the chair, because for some reason the UN was worried about being drowned in letters by 'concerned citizens'. So the position of Leader of Humanity's Hope fell to a second-rate captain of an Arctic research vessel. Somehow a career of ordering around undergraduates and sticking tags onto birds was to make a man an emperor. The officers of the ship did do their best to act surprised when they found him with his throat cut open, and perhaps Lal or Godwinson or Skye were genuine, but she knew they were waiting for somebody to do it.

*Ha, good father,*

*Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,*

*Threaten his bloody stage. By th' clock, 'tis day,*

*And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.*

*Is't night's predominance or the day's shame*

*That darkness does the face of earth entomb*

*When living light should kiss it?*

*'Tis unnatural,*

*Even like the deed that's done.*

Skye, the eternal teacher's pet. She knew that Zakharov tried to remove Skye from the ship roster, and Garland pushed to get him overruled. The reason why died with him. Did he want to have one more lackey he could depend on, something he knew he could control? Or did the old man fall for the accent? It didn't matter, what matter was that she came here to Planet, and she gathered together enough thralls to set up her little society. Santiago had to give her credit at this point, she was the last one she thought would enter the game once Garland was gone. The last time the two saw each other in the flesh was at the vote on the Unity.

*Seven sat at the captain's meeting room, minus a captain. The chair was empty, the voice of mediation that once came from it silent. Fires the captain would've long ago put out were raging across the room. Some of them were doing their best to protect the Mission, to keep the statement of the UN as humanity's consensus, but it was becoming clear to them that the others were singing different tunes.*

*"It is clear to all here that this attempt at a schism is the result of a murder, the ploy of a criminal.", Lal beckoned the table to consider. He was a surgeon, not a politician or public speaker, but the pressure he felt to calm the heads of those facing him reminded of hours of work administering chemotherapy, the methodical and stressful work to remove a cancer before it destroyed a life. "We are playing into the hands of an agent of chaos if we allow this ship to fracture."*

*"The circumstances of Garland's death are worrying, that is true.", began Morgan, perhaps the biggest unknown of anyone here, "But that does not excuse it of happening. This ship is without a leader, no amount of squabbling will undo that."*

*An empty laugh was the only audible reaction to the tycoons words, a rare laugh from Commander Yang. "So says the stowaway. Director Lal is correct, the actions of a rogue must not condemn the Mission to chaos, we all swore to uphold the Charter. And within that charter is a line of succession, in which the role of Captain goes to the Second-In-Command, the Chief of Security, which is me."*

*All eyes were on Yang. None cut into him so much as those of the Chief Psychologist. "How are you sure that you are Chief of Security? How are you sure you have any more right to be on this ship than Morgan? You might've indeed passed all psychiatric tests on Earth with flying colours because of your honest ability, but I am not a woman easily fooled, Yang, I've tested some of the despots of the world we've left behind, and might I say, I've become familiar with their type. 'Line of succession'? Were you worried Garland might produce an heir and undermine your claim to the throne?" Godwinson was angry at how difficult Yang had made her position. She was under oath to divulge the questionable accuracy of Yang's results, but the very charter she was trying to keep together pointed towards Yang as being the sole man on the ship with the right to take the chair, with his Lieutenant Santiago doubtless taking the lead of Security. Nobody, with the exception of Santiago, wanted Yang as Captain, and such was one of the biggest obstacles in keeping the Mission together.*

*Santiago was technically the lowest-ranked person in the room, but was lately commanding a lot of support with the crew in Security. The others were fully aware of the army she in practice had under her thumb. "So we should trust the word of the Ship Chaplain, then? Are you one to complain about putting undeserved faith into undeserving authority? We all went through those tests, if you are going to call one case into question, why not call into question them all?"*

*Lal re-entered the fray, "Lieutenant, your addition to debate is always welcome, and we are familiar with your opinions on the Divine, however your talk is out of line, and you are jeopardizing the integrity of this mission."*

*The meeting room filled with a howl of laughter, laughter from a source that did not laugh often laughter as deep as a puddle and as sincere as a conman. When Santiago was done, she continued.*

*"You believe this mission has integrity? This mission is a mess. As it stands it is the white elephant of a world bureaucracy, from a world falling apart. This is a ship built by the lowest bidder, and I should know that, because he is sitting right next to me. In front of me are defendants of the politicians that had squandered decades of time to only produce this single, pathetic voyage into the naked unknown. You suggest to me that I am the one jeopardizing integrity? You might be looking at one of the few with any integrity left.*

*The five onlookers, individuals of various levels of experience at debate, were unnerved as one at the meeting of glares between Santiago and Lal, superseding even the abortive tirade between Godwinson and Yang. Zakharov was the first to dare breaking the silence. "Perhaps the debate is getting too personal. If there is still a solution, then it will not be reached by bickering. Now, I am sure nobody here is desiring a split of crew, a dividing of resources benefits no one. But perhaps a modification to the Charter as it holds right now can make everyone happy, or content at the minimum? After all, we were all selected for our ability to adapt when it is necessary."*

*"No, absolutely not." Lal was the most surprised of all to hear such direct words come from his mouth. Zakharov was Chief Science Officer and hence Third-In-Command, making him Lal's superior. Managing to realise the implications of what he was doing, he saw that the only measure he could take was finish his point. "The UN Charter is the creation of 9 billion humans, who fought and saved and died and survived to keep the wisdom of thousands of years of history alive. We are only seven, the figureheads of one million. An amendment to the Charter can only come from Earth. That is the end of it."*

*"Lal."*

*This was a new voice for the meeting. Effectively, she was the smallest player sitting at the table, by far the most reluctant leader and with the smallest following. For months she had been the inoffensive glue between Garland, Godwinson and Lal, the mediator, the voice of calm for the egos. She was dependable, reliable, loyal.*

*Deirdre said to Pravin, "Earth is dead."*

*Somehow, this dispelled the tension in the air, only for it to come back anew. In a certain, indescribable way, the tension felt bigger, wider, that much less comprehensible.*

*"The dish has been repaired for two months now, and they would be sure that we would now be ready to make Planetfall. If there was anyone still alive on Earth, we would hear it. But even now, we hear nothing, not the faintest radio signal. Earth isn't falling apart, it isn't going out of control, it is dead. All there is now, is us."*

*For an instant, seven human beings sat together at a table. Beside all the struggling, all the arguments, there had been the mutual denial of one harsh truth. For the first and last moment, Pravin and Sheng-ji, Miriam and Prokhor, Nwabudike and Corazon were all on the same page.*

*"There is us and Chiron. Now, I am not a student of politics, or business, or war, but I know enough to realise we have managed to bring them all with us to the stars. I am afraid that, with things as they are, a united crew will only allow one of you to attain control over all of humanity, and of the new home we now seek. Not one person here deserves that authority. The one person who might treat it with respect is now dead, possibly by the hands of someone at this table."*

*Deirdre stood up, straightening the creases in her uniform.*

*"I will have to inform my crew. You will all need to inform yours. I'm sorry."*

*Skye walked out of the room.*

*All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!*

*All hail, Macbeth!*
