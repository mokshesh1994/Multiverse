Author's Note: This is my first story.

I sit at my desk in my room, the walls are white and it is pretty bland except for the picture of a Union soldier on the wall. He or she, it is impossible to tell what gender a soldier is with all the armor, wears bulky white armor made to 'resist' plasma blast. The reality of it is that the plasma still burns through it without trouble because of, plasma. 

I glance back at my computer screen, it is old, about 200 years old and is called a 'Personal Computer'. it is one of the few left in the world, now there are just 'MCC', or Mass Collection Computers, connected to every device in the world. I have a blank document open for this old program called 'Microsoft Word' up on my screen, it writes down what you type. I really want to write a story but I do not know what...
I would glance out of my window, looking at the Rexon Cargo Liner gliding by, the engines roaring as it went past and then fading away. I glance back at my computer screen and get an idea of what I am going to write about. I put my fingers on the keyboard and type in these very words: "Author's Note: This is my first story."
