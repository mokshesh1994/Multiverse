Cory took his family to the cabin again and bolted down the door. The wind battering the weak old cabin reminded Cory about an old movie called Interstellar. Devon lit a match and put it in a lantern, filling the one story house with an eerie glow. Cory took off his helmet.

"How many supplies do you have?" he questioned Linda.

"Not many," she replied. "I'm surprised that we've gone this far without being raided or something.

"Raided?"

"Yes. There are people in cars that drive by the cabin and are searching for people to steal and murder." That sent chills up Cory's spine. A few hours later, Devon went to a cabinet and brought out a dusty jar of pickled okra. He opened the jar and they each had an okra. Soon after that, the cabin stopped shaking, and it was quiet. Cory put on his helmet and walked outside after de-bolting the door.

There was a beautiful sunset. The sky was lit up by violets, crimsons, fiery oranges, and the subtlest of stars. He could see the landscape in its entirety, too. Not far from the cabin, he could see a lumber truck buried halfway into the sand. In the distance, he could see the tiny glimpse of civilization. It looked abandoned, of course, but he ran towards it, anyway. On the way, past dead trees and one that had a bit of pine needles still on it, Cory noticed a mechanized infantry car, still standing. Cory tried opening the door, to only be opened by a skinny boy, about sixteen years old, wearing an oxygen mask and pointing a rifle at the astronaut.

"Hello," Cory said. "I am Captain Cory Amos."

"A captain, huh?" the boy was shaking violently. "What army?"

"Fort Yukon 51st Infantry."

"You're Alaskan? You look like a Statesman to me."

"I get that a lot. I only look like a Statesman because I come from the States."

"What State?"

"Colorado, born and raised."

The boy put down his gun. "My grandfather was born in Colorado. I'm Fredrick. My infantry died of dehydration."

Cory suddenly grew uncomfortable. He turned around to see nobody, but turned back to see Fredrick pointing the rifle once again.

"A set-up," Cory gasped.

"Yeah, I knew you were Cory Amos. You broke the law in Juneau, didn't you?"

Cory took the rifle from his hands, but noticed the bodies he thought were dead, now pointed pistols at Cory.

"You're a fugitive," Fredrick smirked. "And we'll bring justice."

To be concluded...
