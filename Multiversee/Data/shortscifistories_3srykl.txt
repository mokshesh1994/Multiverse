Back to Earth

Vessel A-59 was sent to a wormhole carrying a million-odd colonists and was bound to a habitable planet orbiting a G2V star in the Virgo Supercluster. The mission was to populate the planet and turn it into an annex, as the planets of the Home Star are no longer feasible for future habitation.

Out of the million variables in play, the one that was not accounted for was the solar flare that knocked the vessel out of its intended flight plan, and took out all the nav systems on board.

Instead of a smooth rocket-assisted landing, A-59 crash landed into the planet and ultimately caused an impact crater so huge, the unsettled dust covered the planet's atmosphere and killed its inhabitants.

The colonists stayed inside the vessel until they ran out of food and life support. One day, they were forced to climb out.

No one knew what happened to the colonists until a hyperspace probe from Annex-26.1 surveying the Virgo Supercluster picked up a deep-space craft of unknown origin.

The probe was identified by cryptographers as Voyager-1 from a planet called "Earth", and it carried a primitive disc containing various audiovisual recordings of the planet. It was millions of years old, far outdating the first people of the first planet of the Home Star.

Yet they all cheered and rejoiced to find out that somehow, A-59 survived after all.
