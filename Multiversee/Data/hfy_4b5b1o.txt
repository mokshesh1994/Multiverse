Aboard the Nakamura, relics of machinery ages old had begun to stir. Sparks of life had finally been reignited on the Behemoth of Human Ingenuity. These sparks of reignition had worked their way to the engines, forcing them to cry out, careening into their new lives much like newborn children. As the earsplitting, booming sound of the engines rose and rose, various other parts of the Nakamura had begun to regain power. While the Life Support Systems were still offline, it appeared that Scarlet had 'cleaned house' as it were, to make room for exciting new events of come. Groans and moans of the ship's churning gears had rather annoyed Scarlet, whom then chose to have the ship come back to life a little more slowly, as to not disturb her quite as much. It did bring Scarlet joy to see herself back online and to see the ship slowly coming back to life, but it all lead to a sense of melancholy. She did not quite enjoy the fact that she had been offline for such a long period of time, and she understood through tactile evidence that humans could only survive for a maximum of 200ey (Earth Years). She sifted through her databanks once more.

___________________________________________________________________

The United Earthling Ship the Nakamura had been launched out into the void only a few days prior. Scarlet had yet to be activated, as humanity thought it best to make sure everyone knew how the entirety of the ship worked before introducing the world's first learning AI companion. 'Had yet to be activated' may be misleading, however, as Scarlet had been through years upon years of development. At first, engineers had what could very well be considered as the universe's very first infant AI. That term can be taken quite literally. The actions and behavior that Scarlet had been undertaking at the time of her very, very first incarnation were bearing quite a large resemblance to that of a child. All she really did was look at things, providing different reactions to different stimuli, much like a human baby would have. Eventually, they had her stacking blocks on top of each other with the use of a sort of crane feature that had been specifically designed for deconstructing and assembling pieces of harvested minerals. However, Alpha Scarlet insisted.

Alpha Scarlet had been taught to do various simple tasks, but it was nothing that a human could not do with at least 86% more accuracy. Much like a human infant, she needed plenty of time to learn before she could endure the stress of managing an entire ship. Researchers sped up the process a little bit by installing a software piece that allowed Alpha Scarlet to read over 1000 pages of information every second. Needless to say, she became quite the brainiac. After awhile, Alpha Scarlet had started becoming bored of what the researchers needed her to read, so she started going slightly rogue and began to read works of fiction. How this happened or how these files had gotten into her databanks, nobody knows, but Scarlet had insisted that they stayed. An AI's way of insisting is to move the files to every folder on the databanks so nobody knew how to delete them all without going and deleting every file in her mind. It proved to be quite a hassle. She read more fiction than anyone had ever though possible until she seemed like a bubbly six year old little girl with an abundance of imagination. The researchers were quite annoyed with this turn of events, and later went on to scrap almost all of the fictitious works in the databanks. Keep note that this did not stop Alpha Scarlet from making new ones herself.

It would be hard pressed to find anyone who would say that they quite enjoyed working with Alpha Scarlet, but deep down, it seems she had played to the human sense of nurture and care. After some amount of time, the researchers began to interact with her in different ways. Not only as a professional researching division, but also as a group of caring adults. There was a bittersweet factor to working on Scarlet during her Alpha stages. While she was a great companion that had remarkable capability and knowledge, her focus was quite.... Unfocused to the point where she would read novels in her spare seconds and read analysis papers on those novels in seconds when she should have been doing a million-and-one other things. Upon request, Alpha Scarlet was known to write several pieces of her own fiction including poems to full blown novels, these then became international best sellers.

Alpha Scarlet had many bugs that the researchers and engineers had to work out together. Instead of allowing Scarlet to read whatever she wants, they chose to keep some files hidden from her. Instead of allowing Scarlet to see all of her responsibilities and capabilities at once, they limited her viewpoint; first by category, then by time. What seemed to be a horrible Hollywood-style idea became a huge help for Scarlet's development. She learned to manage different pieces of the ship and her resources depending on the surrounding situation and time. If it had been too long since something was inspected, it would automatically show up, even if it did not require maintenance. If something had been reported to require maintenance, it would then move up in the queue. With the best technology and minds coming together, great things were bound to occur.

Huge apologies to all for this chapter being in the works for days longer than anticipated! I kept having conflicting ideas as to how the story would pan out and I needed to settle them by writing no less than 8 variations of this chapter. Apologies!
