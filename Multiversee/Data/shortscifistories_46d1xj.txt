Hello, my name is Dr. Peter Jacobs.  These log entries will serve as ancillary remarks concerning the construction and operational phases of Project Delphi.  In brief, Project Delphi consists of an extremely accurate array of quantum and molecular sensors and computational apparatus and is designed to investigate the ability to predict the future actions of animate objects.  For background, previous projects have been able to predict the state of the registers of a microprocessor given its inputs at a specified time.  As a consequence, apparatus employed in these projects could predict the movements of simple machines and robots anywhere from several seconds to several hours into the future.  The current project seeks to understand the absolute ability to predict the future actions of more complicated biological systems, including plants and animals.

Construction of Project Delphi is proceeding as planned with initial operations expected on July 1st.  To provide additional context, prevailing public opinion has held that consciousness cannot be explained by completely deterministic laws of physics.  Many individuals feel that laws of physics which are absolute do not allow room for free will to exist or to be expressed.  However, others question the importance of quantum phenomena to cognitive processing and their ultimate influence on thought and action.  They argue that macroscopic physical principles can adequately explain all of the salient features of animal, and human, behavior, and that quantum phenomena do not correlate to any appreciable extent to consciousness or other qualia.

The initial tests have been a resounding success!  Morale is extremely high as the staff and myself celebrate the culmination of months, and in some sense, years of work.  We were able to replicate the observations of several of the earlier projects which dealt with microprocessors and robots.  Then, more macroscopically nonlinear systems, including chemical reaction-diffusion experiments, were predicted for several minutes.  I am looking forward to some well-deserved sleep!

The experiments have been progressing even faster than expected, and almost all of the staff are extremely excited.  Unfortunately, I feel the need to report a peculiar phenomenon which I have witnessed.  With more sophisticated experiments, including those performed with worms and fruit flies, the sensors and computational apparatus have exhibited a far greater forward-prediction time than was expected.  Several times, the device was able to predict the flight and landing pattern of a single fruit fly for over 30 minutes.  Several staff members expressed a sense of uneasiness upon witnessing the results, stating that it appeared somewhat uncanny.  One of my subordinates joked that we could literally see into the future.  And although the namesake of this project purported to do just that, I had to remind her that we were only predicting what had not yet happened.

Unfortunately I must report that one of our staff suffered a panic attack during experimentation this afternoon.  After accurately predicting the movements of a gerbil for just under four minutes, the staff member appeared to enter a comatose state.  Several seconds later, he began to turn away from the control screens and walked briskly to the door.  Upon detainment and questioning by security, he stated that we were not real and that we were in a dream.  Based on my professional opinion, I sent him to the on-site medical facility to undergo psychiatric evaluation.  I will monitor the well-being of the staff more closely.

I would like to return to several previous remarks.  Some individuals are of the opinion that the fundamental uncertainty of quantum phenomena creates unknowable recesses of the universe which consciousness may or may not inhabit.  Some say this shows that we can never know if free will is being exercised, since there are pockets of reality which exist even beyond description by classical laws of physics but which do not appear to be described by any alternative models.  However, I believe that the empirical data generated so far is putting a lower bound on how soon any possible conscious phenomena can impact macroscopic behavior.  We were able to predict how "Lucy" the dog would bark for six entire minutes.  Was her conscious mind unable to have any noticeable impact on her body for six whole minutes, or did it simply not exist?

Many staff are frightened, and I must admit that I am beginning to feel increasingly unnerved.  No.  I already felt that way several days ago, and now there is a genuine sense of fear.  During the experiments, it seems as though the staff are watching parts of their free will ripped apart right in front of them.  One of them joked that if they could have no direct control of their bodies for several minutes, they shouldn't care about working.  Or maybe he wasn't joking.  Maybe he was unnerved and scared.  I put him in line.  But maybe I agreed with him.

Security found one of the staff trying to conduct an unauthorized experiment this morning.  Reportedly he stated that he had to know if it was real.  I don't blame him.  Why even still use animals?  Why not just walk in there and get it all over with?  If we really don't have any control, is it better to face reality or live in a fool's paradise with an abundance of fear?

Alright, this is it.  The security teams are changing shift and I've turned off the cameras for "maintenance".  Three minutes should be enough.  I'll scream.  Everything.  Everything random, at the top of my lungs.  The computer will never predict me.  I'll scream and break the laws of physics.

What exactly has been typing these messages?  I'm pretty sure I have no control.
