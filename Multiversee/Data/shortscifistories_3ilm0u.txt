I don't know who I'm writing this for.

Actually that's a dirty lie, the first thing I've committed to this log and I'm already deceiving it.

Maybe I am taking on all of humanity's guilts and motivations, taking on all the lonely fears, all the wild dreams, all the maniacal tendencies. After all, I'm the last one left. All of the remaining great, terrible and bemusing events in the rest of human history, all of them are mine. I have earned this torture.

There isn't much time left, dear log. Not much left at all. I don't know exactly when. When my turn arrives. When my position last in line gets called. That's my motivation, log. I can't get the guilt and the fear and the loneliness out of my thoughts, so I may as well put them on paper. Paper and pencil, that's what it's come down to, my most treasured possessions. I hold them close to me at all times. Now they are mankind's most powerful tools, maybe not for the first time.

Enough! 

Let's start at the beginning. The decisions I made. The mistakes committed, the crimes perpetrated, and the consequences I ignored in my blindness. As it turns out, the motivations for saving humanity are indistinguishable from the motivations for extinguishing humanity: unbridled arrogance. That arrogance was mine. All mine. I won't blame Jos, who engineered the thing. I won't hold Diane accountable, whose initial idea it was. Not her husband, Joe. Oh how I hated Joe, his money, and his easy self confidence, comfortably smug without realising it. Joe financed everything, all of us were in on it, we all shared the vision, the dream. But it was my dream that we shared.

Another failure. I hear them coming. My atonement is incomplete, will...
