Together
Redem10
My wife wonders why I have been so distant lately. She finds it strange why each time she talks about our past, I look so confuse and rarely have any idea as to what event she is referring to. I have lost all familiarity with our neighbourhood, both with the people living in it and I often get lost when I walk around it. She asks herself why I haven't touched her in weeks, when I used to be so passionate with her in bed. There is no longer any intimacy between us and it seems to have happened quite suddenly. The fact that I can barely pull a comfortable face when she and the children are around doesn't help. The strain of this abrupt change is hard for everyone in the family. We may still pretend things haven't change right now, but I know it won't last for long.

A look into her internet history revealed that she's looking into the possibility that I might be afflicted by some mental issue. I know it is not quite the case, but I am tempted to make her believe she is right. Perhaps get myself checked in a mental hospital is the best option. I know that I do not belong here and that I should not be with her. She might be forever grateful and loving to me, but I know that I do not deserve to be with her. I was well intentioned, but I was careless. Now, I have taken a man life and now I am destroying  his family. A husband that was once so close to his wife and children is now gone and was replaced by a complete stranger.

I should not have not gone straight back to the present after saving her life.  My wife is now living with a man that has known nothing but the pain of losing her for 15 years.
