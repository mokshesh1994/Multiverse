Weightlessness

There were a few rewards, as a star-traveler.  The praise.  The pay.  The fame.  I never got sick of hearing people tell me how brave I was, running shuttle missions back and forth between space stations, I'll tell you that.

My personal favorite, though, was the feeling immediately after take off.  G force is the weight of the home of our ancestors who lived on Earth; it's one of those archaic things, honestly.  The G forces as we kicked off, planet to planet, varied.  But there was always the weightlessness.

Drifting, occasionally with my hair in my face, hanging by nothing but my harness.  It was beautiful.  It was addicting.  The feeling of that weightlessness got to be like breathing; I needed it, when I didn't have it, and when I did I was really and truly alive.

As it turns out, I don't so much fancy weightlessness, when it's just me and nothing else, drifting here in the void.
