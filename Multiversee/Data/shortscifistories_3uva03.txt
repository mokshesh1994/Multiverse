Possibilities

Luke hurried to his terminal as his hands began working urgently.  Tonight would be it!  When he walked into the research complex it had been sunset and the biting wind had begun to make its presence known; in a few hours it would be frigid.  But that was fine with Luke, as he wouldn't be leaving then.

Over the past few years, many aspects of quantum mechanics had been exploited and even found their way into smaller computers.  No longer exclusively inhabiting the realm of the supercomputer, the containment cells, or "ice boxes", of the quantum bits had become miniaturized.  As a brilliant young scientist, Luke was about to accomplish something much more grand and impressive.  Hugh Everett and Bryce Seligman DeWitt had been pioneers of the many-worlds theory, but Luke would take the quantum leap, as it were.  He would explore all of those possibilities.

As he breathed life into the incredible machine, the hum and whirring sounds began to bleed through into the observation room.  It was massive, far larger than the first and second-generation particle accelerators.  Luke had recently been awarded the highest level of security clearance, despite some arguments raised regarding his state of mind, and he could test and operate the device on his own, albeit only briefly.  But he would have enough time.  As well as all of the time in the world.

Luke had been the first man to give her flowers, and she had beamed back at him and laughed almost every moment of their first date.  She was beautiful, and several months later confessed her love as they lay in bed talking about their future.  How had things gone so wrong?  Why did she stop loving him?

Luke knew he had to find his one horrible mistake than drove her away.  The device would reach the gateway threshold in four minutes and then he could sift through all of the possibilities to choose a more wonderful outcome.  But first, he would use it in a completely trivial way; he would use it to view his past.  Luke had opened all of the spreadsheets and databases, and promised himself he would find his error.  She would love him forever.

Eventually the shock and swell of emotions subsided as Luke was able to retrace their past.  He cried when he saw her receive her flowers, and came to the realization that their first date was even better than he had remembered.  Fine details that had been lost in his mind flowed back to him in supreme beauty.  She was so wonderful.  What had happened?

For the past twenty minutes, a modicum of confusion had begun to brew in Luke's mind.  Where exactly did he go wrong?  Frantically he searched through the more recent past.  To be sure, she had loved him.  And from the images Luke once again inferred that her feelings had faded.  But he couldn't pin it down to any one specific thing that he, or she, had done.
_______________________________
The database eventually began to fill with small, insignificant discrepancies, although Luke had begun to debate that last part.  Different music, different humor, different hopes for the future.  She had wanted to travel and focus on her poetry, while he couldn't wait to begin the next phase of his project.  His eyes burned as he leaned back in his chair.  No, it was deeper than that.  Over the past half-hour it had become clear that something just wasn't...right.  And it wasn't just inconsequential disagreements, although perhaps those were shadows of some real problem.

Tears had welled up when Luke saw her crying alone in her bed when he had worked an overnight shift.  But it wasn't because she was lonely, but from what Luke thought he was beginning to grasp, it was because she felt guilty.  She had done her best to feel the same way, Luke was now convinced of it.  He had become desperate when the intimacy had ended, and then the snuggling, and then the kisses.  Luke had become gradually more upset, but upon seeing her tears at night, he felt ashamed.

He found plenty of trajectories where they had stayed together, even for years, but despite his genuine efforts, he could never stop the tears.  A warning began to flash on one of the monitors.  Coolant substation 17 had begun to experience a loss of pressure head.  It must be a leak somewhere.  The techs could probably repair it easily in the morning, but he wouldn't be able to work much longer tonight.

Luke had decided, he would go back and have them part ways the moment her love for him ended, or as close to it as he could estimate.  The coolant continued to leak as he frantically searched through the wonderfully complex world of decisions and alternate choices.  He had to find it.
__________________________
In a strange way Luke felt satisfied.  They had, after all, left amicably.  The leak had accelerated and the emergency shutdown protocols had caught Luke by surprise, and he hadn't been able to take anything back.  He thought about the flowers and reveled in the happiness they had brought her.  The demise of their relationship had been relatively quick, and perhaps they could better appreciate what would happen in the future.  One of Luke's colleagues had once suggested that theirs was the only universe to enjoy completely free will, at least from their perspective.  And only their infinitesimally tiny pocket enjoyed the reality of their decisions, again from their perspective.  Perhaps that had helped them learn the most.

The gusting wind greeted Luke as he made his way outside.  He walked to his car while debating about what to do the next morning.  Call up his friend or visit his brother's family?  But he was tired, and would need his last bit of intellect to drive home.  Luke finally decided to table his decision; after all, he had time, and the world was full of possibilities.
