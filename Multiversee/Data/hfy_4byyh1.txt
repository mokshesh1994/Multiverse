[Biotech] [OC] Observations on human Bioengineering
StaplerTwelve
Heres a short story for the Biotechnology contest. I had some trouble fitting it in one of the categories but in the end Im going for Bioengineering.


Im studying Biotechnology/Life Sciences myself so I just had to write SOMETHING for this contest. :) I havent forgotten A Chance Meeting and Ill certainly continue it! It has just been a couple hectic past few weeks, I should be able to write more in after 2 more weeks time when my current project for school is wrapped up.


-----------------------


Herein are presented the notes made by expert observers of [Biotechnology - Bioengineering] on the [Human] species. This data was collected on the [Human] homeworld, while at development level [ANOMALY]. We, experts in the field of [Biotechnology - Bioengineering] hope our notes on this new species will help the Red Star League Council make a wise decision on how to approach this new species.


* Weve identified countless educational centers that focus on, or have departments for Biotechnology. This is surprising since there are only a few centers in all of Red Star League territory.


* Teachers and students both seem to show a disregard for most common laboratory safety guidelines in these laboratories. Instead of full body hazard suits they often wear nothing more than fabric coats and thin gloves while in a room with enough chemicals to easily kill them. The chemical storage security of the laboratory building also seems wholly inadequate, there are no guards and all teachers seem to carry the keys necessary to open the storage.


* We suspect that the species have advanced knowledge about Biotechnology, weve observed countless experiments being taught to younger generations on a seemingly routine basis that we would consider fairly advanced ourselves.


* This is ludicrous. We just discovered that Humanity has sequenced their entire Genome, and that of multiple other animals on their planet. No other species in the Red Star League has accomplished this feat. The idea is brought up often but without giant leaps in sequencing technology it is quite simply an impossible and endless task. 


* It appear genetically modified foods are extremely common on this planet, the humans have far more advanced that we are in this field, theyve dramatically increased their yield and the protection of the crops to the many diseases that roam free on this planet. Although some opponents remain even they unknowingly consume products that are linked to genetic engineered crops.


* Insane.. Absolutely insane.. Theyve modified Bacteria to produce human hormones.


* Gene therapy, I dont even..


* Of course theyre growing and printing entire limbs. 


* We have no idea what is going on with their stem cell research but it is absolutely insane.


* Were pulling out, it is clear human have a far deeper understanding of biotechnology then we have. Their successes where we have given up are completely anomalous, we can learn a lot from how theyve tackled the insurmountable odds by just getting started instead of declaring the task is impossible like weve done.


The Biotechnology expert observers sat restless in the waiting area before the council chambers. The entire waiting room was filled with disheveled and confused scientists from all imaginable fields in the Red Star League. The electrical computing group of experts had seemingly been given the largest shock, two observers were hyperventilating in fetus position while the third had died of a heart attack during their 5 minute long observation. The nuclear engineers had not even shown up to present their findings. After their observations the ship had simply deserted and set course for the other side of the universe.


Everyone in the waiting room could hear shouting from the council chambers, multiple councilors had fled the chambers already with panicked looks in their eyes. The military observers had started their presentation almost 4 hours ago...
