**Marketing Managers Log: Silcorporation [Year 2654]**

&nbsp;

**[01.05]** My friend from the HR Department informed me today, that I will get a new employee starting next month. It seems like that our management has finally heard my plea for more people in order to deal with the heavy influx of work recently. According to the personal file, the new employee comes from the newly discovered species called Humanity and goes by the name Philip. Im looking forward to meet him.

&nbsp;

**[01.06]** Note to all employees: Due a small incident during the introduction of our newest team-member, it is now forbidden for everyone to greet any Human with their traditional ritual called Handshake. Im sure that our new colleague didnt intended to break anyones limb. 

&nbsp;

**[02.06]** Philip received a pay rise of 20 percent today because he called our CEO slim and good-looking even thought this isnt true at all. Apparently it helps your career if you flatter your boss. 

&nbsp;

**[05.06]** In order to not put too much pressure on Philip, I send him home for the remainder of the week. My only hope is, that thirteen days are enough time for him to recover from the stress.

&nbsp;

**[18.06]** It appears that Humans are very fast learners since Philip has already completed his two week long training course in just three days. Apparently Humans have  in comparison to other species -  a very developed cerebral cortex and thus are capable of adjusting themselves quickly to new situations. Since Philip has already finished his training course and we dont have any work for him planned yet, I send him home again. 

&nbsp;

**[25.06]** Poor Philip. His first real day at work and he had to attend several long and tedious meetings. Still, I have to say that he managed the meetings very well which  according to him  was thanks to a human technique called napping. It is nice to see Philip working so hard for the benefit of our company.

&nbsp;

**[02.07]** Today, Philip accidentally destroyed his office chair after trying to sit on it for the first time. As I was informed, Humans come from a planet with high gravity and thus are heavier than they look like. Because Philip cant do any work without his chair, I had to send him home again. 

&nbsp;


**[06.07]** Philip accidentally destroyed his computer. It seems like that his species is prone to short outbursts of anger if their equipment doesnt work correctly. Since he cant work without a computer, I have send him home.

&nbsp;

**[12.07]** A bulletproof window was installed after Philip threw out his new computer when it didnt worked. As a punishment, I forbid him to work for four days. 

&nbsp;

**[13.07]** It is forbidden for Philip to clap with his hands sarcastically if the computer works as intended. Two colleagues had to go to the hospital since they couldnt hear anything anymore. 

&nbsp;

**[15.07]** What a busy day. We got swarmed with work but Philip managed well. He even managed to finish his share of work before lunch. As a thanks for that, I promised to buy him lunch today. 

&nbsp;

**[15.07  Afternoon]** Note to myself: Never buy lunch for Philip again. Despite their look, Humans can eat for ten of my kind. My wallet cant afford that much again.

&nbsp;

**[18.07]** Philip saved our entire company today. All our computers suddenly didnt work anymore but he saved the day by doing something called: Turning it off and on again.

Note to Self: Suggest Philip for a promotion.

&nbsp;

**[21.07]** Im very fond of Philip. Despite the fact that he already does the biggest share of work in our department, he still offered to help out his colleague whose son had an accident. According to Philip, writing two more business letters wasnt too much to do even thought it takes usually six hours to write one of them. Could it be that Humans have a higher metabolic rate than other species and thus have a faster perception of time?

Note to Self: Find out Humans metabolic rate and how this would affect the economy.  

&nbsp;

**[25.07]** As a thank you for helping him out, Xo-Kno-Lin offered to buy Philips lunch. Unfortunately I was too late to warn him and he spend over half of his fortune to buy food for Philip. It seems like that the pride of his species prevented Xo-Kno-Lin from taking back his offer after finding out how much Philip can eat. 

&nbsp;

**[31.07]** At the annual meeting of the department managers, it was revealed that the productivity of my department has gone up 300 percent since Philip has joined my team.

&nbsp;

**[12.08]** Because Philip is capable to do most of our departments work alone, three other members of my team were let go. Because of Philips efficiency, our CEO is considering hiring more Humans.

&nbsp;

**[17.08]** I have finally learned what the word napping means. I rebuked Philip for sleeping during the meetings and submitted an official complaint to the HR department. 

&nbsp;

**[18.08]** Our CEO has personally torn apart my written complain about Philip. It seems like it helps your career if you are nice to the CEO and go regularly out for a drink with him. 

&nbsp;

**[24.08]** I have found out that Humans have indeed a faster metabolic rate than other species and thus are able to work so much faster than anyone else. I have also found out that Humans compare us to a native animal on their home planet called a Sloth.

&nbsp;

**[25.08]** While I tried to warn the government that our entire economy was at stake due the fast metabolism of Humans, Philip introduced a hot liquid called coffee which increased the companys overall productivity by 200 percent. It seems like that my worries were unjustified since all employees are now capable of working as fast as Philip.

&nbsp;

**[31.09]** Due the liquid called coffee, productivity in all departments has gone up 300 percent. 

&nbsp;

**[10.10]** Automatic Log update due mentioning of company name in the press. Name of company was mentioned two times in following text:

*The market was shocked today by the announcement, that the company Silcorperation had to permanently close their doors after all of their employees had been delivered to the hospital earlier this week. According to the doctors, most staff members suffered complete exhaustion due an ergogenic drug which was found inside a brown liquid. Due the virulence of said liquid, not only got the CEO of the company arrested, but the whole company had to be put into quarantine. At first, investors of the company were worried about the sudden closure of the company, but the announcement of a newly founded company by one of Silcorperations former employees named Philip, managed to calm the markets down again.*
