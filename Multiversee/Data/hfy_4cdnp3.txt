[Jenkinsverse] Synesthesia
LSteel4
This is my attempt at creating my own Jverse character.  After reading a lot of Jverse stories I wondered what would it be like if the one truly reliable defense against the humans, the nerve-jam, didn't work on one of them.  Which brings us to my origin story of that person.  I wrote this half awake and didn't have time to edit, help me if you want.

The lights of the lab came to life as a grey large headed man walk in, flanked by two others of the same race.

"We have precious little time to complete our tests."  the lead alien announced, "It will so be impossible to acquire more subjects."

"Ever since the report on Jenkins went public, it has been exceedingly difficult to collect more humans."  spoke the feminine voice to the lead's left.

"We are lucky to have gathered this one, though I must admit it is not an ideal specimen." another feminine voice to the right this time.

"He will suffice, the test we will be using him for are universal to all humans." responded the lead as he stepped up to the control panel.  "Grina, you monitor his neural pathways, and Hrtar, you keep track of vitals and any physical damage which may result from the nerve-jam exposure."

"Yes sir" was the unified response from the two women, thus preparations began.

**Unknown Cell**

Something was wrong, the bed was too hard and his covers were gone.  Maybe they fell off in the night but that didn't explain the bed or, now that he'd thought about it, his missing pillows.  The fat man's eyes shot open and where greeted with a very white room.

Eddy takes stock, he is alone, which isn't unusual, with only his underwear on, a little unusual but not much since he just woke up, and in an almost painfully white room, now that is weird.

"Hello?" Eddy called, "Hello, is anyone there?"

Edward Samson, late twenties, overweight, and had just managed to move out of his parents basement.  Also works at a big box store, you can guess which.  Thinking to himself, "The Fuck?!?!?!"

Eddy stands up and in doing so realizes, for the first time, he has a stylish new watch, with stylish meaning that it covered his whole forearm and resembles a cyber-punk version of arm guards.

Fiddling with the watch a voice fills the room, "I wouldn't touch that, it is likely to save your life multiple times during the tests."

Eddy was startled at first but had enough scene to ask some important questions, "Were is my bed?"  Shaking off that pitiful inquiry he started again, "I mean, where am I, who are you, and what is this watch thing?

The voice responded, "In order, this is my neural research lab, I am Nurt a corti scientist, and the device on your arm generates regenerative enzymes and proteins which will allow you to recover from the almost certainly lethal levels of damage our experiments will cause to your nervous system.  We will begin momentarily."

Eddy wasn't a genius but he was quick enough when he had to be, so he understood everything the voice just said, and that brought up a new important question.  Fearfully he asked, "Why did you tell me all of that?" 

"Because you likely won't remember, begin."

Pain, white hot, ice cold, lukewarm, name any kind of pain you can imagine this topped them all and it was everywhere too.  His head burned, muscles seized, and vision went white, then red, then black.

**Nurt**

"It appears the subject has lost consciousness, how long was that?"

Hrtar responded, "Subject lost consciousness after approximately (5 seconds) of constant exposure to nerve-jam at a distance of (5 meters), the overload from the nervous system seems to have damaged surrounding tissues including brain matter."

"How much damage has his nervous system suffered?"

Grina's turn, "His entire system suffered massive overload and is damaged as a result, however readings show that recovery is proceeding smoothly.  He should be ready for another test within a few (hours)."

"Understood, while he is unconscious deposit a human sized ration of nutrient spheres and water.  We will resume testing after he has eaten.  Until that time we have valuable data to go over."

**Cell**

**Eddy**

Eddy was losing his mind, he had to be after having his nerves burned out over and over again how could he not.  He could swear that he was now hearing and seeing the dough balls they fed him, while they were in his mouth.  No, he no longer swore it any more anymore he fucking knew.  This bastard had fried his brain to many times, the wires were crossed now.  How had he gotten into this mess?

*"I was abducted while I slept."*

"That much I know." Eddy responded, "It was a rhetorical question I was asking myself."

*"And that is why I answered."*

Eddy whirled around to see who was talking, his eyes fell on himself.  At least it looked like himself.  There across the room from Eddy was, Eddy.  But the new Eddy wasn't really there, he knew that somehow, he was hallucinating but could still tell what wasn't real, how.

*"Because due to constant brain damage and repair I have adapted to withstand neurological damage to a degree, this includes knowing with certainty what is and isn't being supplied by my external senses."*

"Who are you?"

*" I am a representation of the subconscious, the adaptation would not be complete unless I had access to the fundamental processes of my brain, however my conscious mind should never be burdened with all the requirements of the subconscious so this representation was born to serve as my liaison to control my subconscious functions."*

"How do you know all of that?"

*" I am the subconscious, I was the one who made the adaptations in the first place."*

Confused but slowly coming around, "Okay, how does this adaptation help me escape?"

*"I don't know, I'm the subconscious, I don't come up with the ideas I just regulate the bodily functions and organize new data for me to use.  It is not my job to live, I just keep me alive."*

"So I'm on my own then, but at least I can stop my heart whenever I want, that might come in handy."

*I will always start it back up before I die though, I am not suicidal."*

"Well having someone else to talk to has helped me to relax a bit even if it is with myself.  So tell me how do these experiments hurt me?"

*"From what the body remembers the nervous system is catastrophically over loaded which causes burnout of nerves, muscle spasms, and organ failure.  If it wasn't for the thing on my arm the first exposure would have been lethal, as well as all of the others."*

Eddy thought on that new information, "Overload, I have an idea, at the next test I want to try it out."

*"Understood."*

**Nurt**

"How has the subject been?"

Grinda responded, "The readings from his nervous system have been diverging steadily for the last (week).  It appears he is developing a severe form of synesthesia, the data also suggests that brain activity has been increasing as well.  Sections thought to be for subconscious functions are becoming more active."

He considered this new condition was obviously result of the extended nerve-jam exposure.  "What of his physical condition?"

Hrtar sighed deeply, "I have just reviewed the last rest period, it appears the subject has begun hallucinating and talking to himself.  I believe he is no longer healthy enough to benefit our research."

After reviewing the footage himself Nurt also had to consider that possibility.  They would have to conclude the research using this subject.  "I have to agree, the experiments have caused permanent damage and any further data would be inadmissible under those grounds.  Also I don't want to take any chances with the disposal a human, too many others have failed to contain them.  After the data has been submitted terminate the subject then dispose of the remains.  Activate a nerve-jam pulse at 0 range."

The little grey women went to work sending off the data then activating the nerve-jam emitters.  Eddy's body went limp and all readings from him flat lined.

**Cell**

The door to the cell opened to reveal a Corti with a hover cart.  He carried with him a kinetic generator to aid in moving the corpse.  As he lifted the body onto the cart for incineration he allowed himself a sigh of relief at the luck of not having to be torn apart by a rampaging deathworlder like so many before him.

It was always quiet walking through the halls of the ship, aside from the hum of the reactor and the soft rhythm of breathing..... wait.

Eddy shot up with a start hacking coughing and clutching his chest.  "MY GOD THAT WAS TERRIFING!"  He quickly rounded on the little grey man pushing his the cart, "Have you ever shut down your own brain?"  The corti couldn't bring himself to answer properly and out of sheer terror released himself.  "I'll take that as a no, and correct me if I'm wrong but your an alien aren't you?"  The corti quickly ran away leaving a trail behind him.  Eddy calmed himself down ignoring the growing mess behind him, as well as the space man, and collected his thoughts.

"Okay" he thought, "I was abducted, by aliens apparently, and now I've escaped my cell, what next.  Escape the building, right.  Now... how do I do that?"  Eddy now sat with a very blank look on his face not really knowing his next step.  Thankfully the alarms went off, and that motivated him to at least start running, however the question still remained.  "What do I do now!?"
