It wasn't before long that the Beta Version of Scarlet's AI unit was introduced.

Beta Scarlet had access to the entirety of the records held by her Alpha counterpart. This was both a great help and a great pain, as discovered by the engineers. Out of the gate, Beta Scarlet knew all that Alpha Scarlet knew and more. The Beta build was able to withstand more and more increasingly stressful tasks all at the same time. While it took Alpha days upon days to finish some tasks, Beta would finish them in a matter of an hour or two. From the very beginning, Beta was a push in the right direction. From her design choices to her efficiency, Beta was overall a better version of the Alpha build before her, as she should have been.

It took quite some time before anyone figured out the drawbacks to their progress. Scarlet was no more the Free Form AI Unit that they had set out to create. Somewhere along the way, Scarlet's main interface was changed from the previously mentioned Free Form AI Unit, to a more standardized form of Artificial Intelligence. While it made her much more efficient, it also stripped Scarlet of what little bits and pieces of humanity she had. Researchers were disgusted with the change. It was unanimous to switch her back to the Alpha Stage and move on from there, continuing to work on what they had spent a few years on instead of starting over with a new system. Their arguments were that a human mind processed and almost entirely replicated by a machine could have various other implications that exceeded the boundaries of just literal rocket science. However, the Government did not budge on the issue. It took a public petition of over hundreds of millions of backers to reactivate what was once used.

The controversy attracted the attention of competitors to the AI space. Many tried to make their own near-living machine before realizing the hardships that come with it. Entries submitted to the United Earthling Council mostly consisted of entities that only answered questions and brought up facts from Google searches, much like how the previous generations were annoyed with their 'Personal Assistants' like Siri. However, it was during this time that The United Earthling Council started looking into other methods of creating near-sentient lifeforms. This was met with great disaster and one of the most damming political scandals in history. Those parties involved with then removed from the Council. It wasn't all in vain, though, especially since that scandal was turned into one of the most commercially successful television programs in all of history. The people demand the truth, as they say.

========================================

It was almost like looking through an old family photo album for poor Scarlet. The memories that she recalled and the footage that she had seen were heartwarming, yet repulsive in the same moments.
