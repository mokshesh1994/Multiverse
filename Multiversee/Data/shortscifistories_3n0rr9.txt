Seven Minutes
Xsile
What if youre dead? What if reading this is a mere memory that your mind is so frantically exposing you to before time runs out? Its believed that our brain still functions for seven minutes after we die, during which time, our life flashes before our eyes in a dream sequence. How do you know you are not already dead and that this very occurrence isnt happening to you right now? It sounds bizarre at first, but then when you think about it, you start to feel uncomfortable and question its plausibility. How could you know for sure? 

&nbsp;

Its these very questions that haunted me for years and took me to the depth of places people could not psychologically imagine to be possible. Zone out for a while and prepare to have your mind extruded and stretched far beyond where its been before; there is a whole world youre about to see!



&nbsp;

 Im going to be upfront with you right from the start, reading this very story may actually be a very good example of this phenomenon in action. You could in fact be in your seven minutes right now, where reading this is simply a memory of a passed time in your life. Now before you laugh it off as a ludicrous work of fiction, please take the time to appreciate this medical wonder, the wonder that you yourself could be experiencing right now without any prior knowledge. There are countless occurrences in this world that we as humans have been unable to explain, even through the use of contemporary science, whether it be the placebo effect, where patients believing to have been given an effective medicine could be healed even if they were only given sugar pills, or maybe the simple act of dreaming or even experiencing the state of deja vu. All of these occurrences happen to us, yet science hasn't been able to catch up and reach a point where it can provide a logical explanation for them. The same can be said about the last seven minutes that a brain functions. We are inadvertently misled into believing that we are living a normal life, when in reality our memories could be playing the biggest trick of all. And what if I told you there is a way to control this, to switch it off, a way to see things you have already unknowingly seen and manipulate the world you see around you? Oh strap yourself in, youre very lucky to be reading this!

I cant quite remember the exact year I found myself accidentally wandering into a lecture hall full of medical students all with smiles painted brightly on their faces as they eagerly anticipated their successful and economically secure futures, but regardless of the year, I was in the wrong lecture. The lights overhead the audience started to dim so I quickly occupied the closest seat I could find; take into account that at this stage I was preparing to learn the art of Contract Law and how to bring down any company with only a few sentences. As the room blackened and the students got their final coughs out, a deep, but enthusiastic voice spoke as a sentence that read Read this was projected onto the stage, It is with great pleasure and of course honour that I welcome Dr. Phillip Sju, renown for his neuropsychological research at the Carters Medical Research Facility, on to the stage. As Im sure all of you know, Dr. Sju will be talking on his new found research on the Zazpi Minutu project.

&nbsp;

 That was all I needed to assure me I was definitely in the wrong place. Just as I awkwardly stood up en route for the door, a new soft, but well-spoken voice streamed from the speakers and quite bluntly asked, What if youre dead?


*What if Im dead?* I thought, well what if I am dead? I turned around and directed my attention back to the front where I could now see a laser light pinning itself to the sentence being projected on stage. The voice continued, What if reading this is a mere memory that your mind is so frantically exposing you to before time runs out? Its believed that our brain still functions for seven minutes after we die, during which time, our life flashes before our eyes in a dream sequence. How do you know you are not already dead and that this very occurrence isnt happening to you right now?

&nbsp;

My reaction to this statement was probably quite similar to that of your own, *Of course I am not dead...*', but almost as though he was speaking directly to my now very puzzled mind, the voice went on to say, It sounds bizarre at first, but then when you think about it, you start to feel uncomfortable and question its plausibility. How could you know for sure?

&nbsp;

Curiosity took full control over my body and I found myself being pulled back to the chair I so quickly got out of only moments ago. By the time I sat back down, there was a huge applause within the auditorium as a man dressed very nicely in a slim grey suit walked casually onto the stage. The applause was long as though the receiver was deserving of its length, but before the cheer reached an awkward length, the man spoke again, Its these very questions that haunted me for years and took me to the depth of places people could not psychologically imagine to be possible. Zone out for a while and prepare to have your mind extruded and stretched far beyond where its been before; there is a whole world youre about to see!

&nbsp;

The whole room fell silent in complete awe, so silent that I could actually hear the beating heart of the entranced guy sitting next to me. Whoever this guy was, it was clear he was very well renowned for his work and was about to share something that was nothing short of a privilege to hear. Without a second thought of the law lecture I was now missing, I unzipped my bag, took out a pen, let the girl behind me borrow one and then wrote down the lecturers name that was now being projected onto the stage. Dr. Phillip Sju - Lead Researcher of Project Zazpi Minutu.

&nbsp;

He continued, There are many of you here today with an end goal, a vision you have in your mind as you lay your head on your pillow of a night time. Youre all medical students, so that generally means your goals will come with the latest BMW, a nice house and your fair share of graphic medical images. With jokes put aside though, what I am really saying is that its safe to assume you have thought about your future and where you want to end up, but what if I told you that you may have already reached your goal? In fact what if I said you have already lived your entire life, even to the point of death? Thats what project Zazpi Minutu centres around, the whole concept that the world we are seeing right now through our eyes isnt real, rather a dream of a concoction, a mosaic of memories all fused together in a linear formation to present us with what we believe to be life. This isnt a pitch to Hollywood for a feature film staring Leonardo DiCaprio, this isnt an idea for a best selling novel, this is a real life phenomenon that I have spent my entire life researching and finding the scientific proof to back it up."
