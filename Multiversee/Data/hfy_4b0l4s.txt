[OC][30000] The Brightest Stars
resonatingfury
Damn, I just barely made it in time- I could hardly edit it D: This is my first OC work rather than using a prompt, hopefully my personal creativity can stand up to the test! Enjoy!

"Honey, come on inside. It's getting chilly and you can't afford to get sick!" a woman said, poking her head out the front door. It was about nine in the evening, and a soft breeze made it feel even colder than it was.

"Sure, sure. I just need a few more minutes out here and I'll be inside, Tess. I had a rough day." He smiled at her, and she knew there was no way to hurry him up.

"Alright. Say hi for me, would you?" she asked playfully, sticking her tongue out.

"Of course."

He looked to brightly glowing moon with all its pockmarks and scars, and the stars, two seemingly brighter than the rest; shimmering with unyielding magnificence. "Thank you," he whispered.

Walking back inside, he already felt better, happily humming as he knelt down to play with his son. "You slay those dragons, Chris. There's no warrior mightier than you!"

**April 17th, 2083**

"Daddy, when will you be back?" Sam asked, mouth full of chocolate cake. *Thank God for boxed devil's food mix. He might never have know the taste of it, otherwise.*

I gazed deeply into my son's blue eyes through parted hair, the same blue of his mother's, and smiled. "I don't know for sure, but I'll be back by your next birthday. I wouldn't let them send me until I celebrated today with you, and I'm going to be back when you turn eleven. Okay? You need a haircut before I get back, that's for sure. It's below your eyes! I might forget you have a face!"

He cracked a massive, stained smile, teeth browned with fudge. "Okay, daddy. I love you, even though you want me to get a haircut."

"I love you too. Beth, don't forget to turn the generator off every night, okay? We don't want it dying while I'm gone. There's a backup if things go wrong, and like with everything else, call Jim if you need help."

"I know, sweetie. You be safe, and come back to us."

I knelt down to Sam, ruffling a pile of light brown hair. "Remember, Sam: don't ever forget our little song. You still know the words, right?"

"You bet I do, Dad." He splayed his legs out, raising his fist in the power stance he always assumes when he goes to sing. "I am human, hear me cry! You can take my body! You can take my life! But you'll never take my soul! Uh...yeah!"

My head tilted back as I rocked with laughter. He looked so serious when he finished that last sentence, and it wasn't even the end- he always forgot the last bits, and yelled it instead of singing. *I thought I'd simplified it enough, but I guess it's a little lame for a Dad to come up with songs.*

There was an armored vehicle waiting outside my house, and I knew I couldn't keep it waiting any longer judging by the blaring horn cutting through noon's usual silence. After kissing my wife and son once more, I grabbed several bags I'd packed and walked outside to begin a long, difficult journey.

Dust kicked up the second I walked outside, right in that awkward middle where it's uncomfortable to walk through but isn't thick enough to block the sight of crumbling buildings and broken homes. The worst of both worlds; dirt in my eyes *and* a forced remembrance of the destruction that rocked our planet not that long ago. Memories flooded my mind, explosions rocking the earth, the sound of screams that slowly dwindled as humanity was reduced to ash...

We pulled into the Pentagon, or what was left of it, where I was greeted by a team of the best men and women in their field. Dr. James Marco, who'd been helping me prepare my body for a year in space- even though we'd hoped it'd be a several week trip, it never hurts to prepare for the worst. He also happened to be a long-time friend of mine, and reliable handyman. Kip Green, an engineer that specialized in communication, was to go with me so that I could maintain contact with Earth even under the worst circumstances. Lyla Brennan, a smooth talker and expert in diplomacy, who swore she'd paint my tongue silver by the time I left.

"Hey! Even Ben's here! I wasn't expecting to see you, buddy!" I patted him on the head, earning a look of burning frustration; for Ben was a person, not a dog. In a sense, he *is* a stray, though- one day, after the attacks, he wandered into the Pentagon bleeding and dizzy. We'd set up a makeshift medical tent and treated him, but when he was cleared to go, he just stayed. The lot of us were discussing how to proceed with the situation and Ben just walked up, handing us water bottles and cracking jokes. Ever since then, he's just come and gone. Nice kid, and he's got a great heart to keep smiling so widely just weeks after everything that happened. Couldn't be more than a few years older than Sam.

"I'm not a dog, Mr. Hoster! Just you wait, I'm going to be a hero like all of you one day!" he yelled, hands on his hips in a pose meant to look majestic.

I couldn't help but chuckle at his enthusiasm. "Us, heroes? I wouldn't go that far. We just do what we can, Ben. In any case, let's go over everything one more time, please. I want to make sure I'm ready."

We stepped into an office in the Eastern section, which was the only section still standing, and spent several hours poring over notes, data and charts until our flight was fully prepped.

A man poked his head into the office. "All right, folks. It's time."

We met up with a piloting crew standing at attention in front of a massive ship that was going to take us to the moon, where *they* had told us to meet them. "When your planet has spun thirty times, we will be waiting on the rock that orbits it," a messenger had told us. Luckily, it was a decent spot for neutral ground- not too far from Earth, should things go awry, and nothing to claim on it. After a few introductions and pleasantries, Kip and I boarded the craft, the crew strapping us into our seats.

To an unknowing spectator, we might've looked like actual astronauts. Engines roared, flames burst, smoke billowed and in mere moments our bodies were soaring through the sky towards progress, and the prospect of peace. Still, everyone was extremely tense, after all- it had barely been a month since Death himself came for our entire species and we'd barely survived. We all lost loved ones, and our way of life was crushed. That isn't something that goes away, not even in the span of an entire lifetime.

Once we'd left Earth's atmosphere safely, drag was no longer an issue and the ride smoothed out nicely. Still strapped into my seat, I pulled my phone out and watched it float around in front of me.

"Are you taking a *selfie*, Chris? Seriously?"

"Yeah, man. My kid is going to love this shit, I'm totally tricking him into thinking I'm an actual astronaut and not just some lame-ass emissary."

Everyone's tension dissipated, replaced with a much needed round of laughter; Good thing, too- the trip was only three days, but three days of anxiety and fear is too much for anyone to stay healthy enough for what was coming.

Kip helped me get out of the seat I was strapped into. "Thanks, Chris. I think everyone needed a little reminder that we don't have to lose ourselves just to get past all this."

"Hey- don't thank me. Maybe the mood lightened when gravity dissipated." I gave him a sly wink and nudge of my elbow.

"Don't push it, now. You've officially reached your daily limit of puns."

"What, are you the pun police now? The... damn, you're lucky I can't think of anything."

"Come on, man. Let's go settle in a bit while we have the chance. Lyla will be contacting us as soon as they let her have access to the comm systems."

"You're definitely right about that. I think I'll get something to eat, too."

Kip made a face of disgust. "Ugh, you want to *eat* immediately after all that jostling and G-force? Are you even human? I'm gonna give it a little while, but there should be a stock of rations in the dining hall-room thing. You'll find it pretty easily, I think. There should be signs. Thankfully, they kept things simple when they redesigned those old missiles we used to see on TV as kids... and I'm sure glad that happened as soon as it did."

In the late 2070's, NASA had officially transitioned to crafts that no longer needed separate boosters that broke off once in space. This both reduced waste left floating through space as well as made things a little safer and easier. Mind you- they weren't anything of fantasy, and still a crude work in progress. Unfortunately, the attacks had made it impossible for the work to be finished, leaving just four finished crafts usable for flight. The idea was that they could be reused, saving an enormous amount of time and money, though no one had ever flown one before... so that was nothing more than a theory.

I pulled myself through the thin, padded corridors, which were labeled with signs quite nicely. In clear, bold letters, I followed the sarcastic words 'Fancy Banquet Ballroom' until I'd reached my destination. *It seems they've made this place a little stupid-friendly so regular guys like me don't get lost.*

It wasn't a ballroom, there was no banquet and it *certainly* wasn't fancy; it was more just a table with straps and footholds to keep you from floating off and a series of cabinets labeled to denote their contents. Unfortunately, though the spacecrafts had advanced, the food had not. I opened the 'Bread' cabinet, pulling out a tortilla, then reached into the 'Condiment' section for a packet of peanut butter and resealable jar of honey. The tortilla came out of its packaging easily enough, but I struggled with the peanut butter a little bit. It came in a foil packet, which I tore and tried to smear cleanly onto the tortilla, but I squeezed a little too early and some of it tried to escape my grasp. With the tortilla firmly in hand, I raised my arm and clamped down on the blob of peanut butter trying to break away, like a shark leaping through the air to catch a bird. A little smear of honey alongside it, and I had a sandwich. Well, the closest thing to a sandwich I'd get- bread wasn't allowed because the crumbs would just float into every corner of every room.

Kip poked his head in as I finished up, eyeing my masterful meal as it spun around in front of me. "Is that a taco?"

"I wish. It's just a *blandwich*. What's up?" Kip groaned at my terrible pun.

"Not much, I spent most of last ten minutes praying to the Porcelain God," he explained, making a retching motion. "Or I would have, if the damn toilet didn't need a seal to work properly. I prayed to a plastic-bag-God. For whatever reason, I can never quite handle the ride up here. Anyway, Lyla is asking for us. Apparently, we've been 'slacking off' for the past few hours."

I sighed and stopped spinning my taco-wich, eating the rest in one bite, then grabbed a moist towelette to clean myself off. I followed Kip to the transmission room, where we'd set up a workspace that had a 100" display for incoming video feed. *Great, a massive Lyla to loom over us literally as well.*

Kip and I took a seat, locking ourselves in place using thigh bars and footholds as leverage. Another man was with us, presumably a pilot. The screen hummed to life, and for several seconds, one hundred inches of Lyla Brennan's face was staring into our souls.

"Oh, sorry about that," she said, backing up to an acceptable distance. "Anyway, are you ready to go over what we know again?"

We sighed, acting disinterested and aloof, which annoyed the hell out of her. "Oh, I see. Well, if I'm so boring, perhaps you should find someone else to help you work through all this."

"It's just a joke, Ly. You know we can't do this without you."

"Well, then. Maybe I *can* help you." Her lips tightened, holding back a smile. "Okay, settle down for a long ride, boys. By the way, the man next to you is Wallace Grimm. He'll be piloting you from the main ship to the moon, Chris."

"Pleasure," he said, holding his hand out and forcing a smile. Kip and I shook his hand, awkwardly introducing ourselves.

"Any updates?" Kip asked drearily, tired of the question.

"Unfortunately, we still have nothing. That bastard, they sent him down here knowing full well we'd end up resorting to these methods and it seems he enjoys the pain- or maybe he just enjoys our frustration. Either way, he still hasn't said a damn word since he delivered the initial message. He just laughs, and sometimes lets loose a frightening mix between a cackle and scream when we're...interrogating him. It's even worse since he speaks through that box on his chest, which is all auto-tuned and computerized."

"God damn it all," Kip uttered, placing his head down on the table.

"It's okay, Kip," I whispered, placing a hand on his back. "We still have plenty of information about them just from the one's anatomy. It's not a lot, but enough to work with. We'll be okay, brother. They feel pain and die just like we do, and we know some of them must be rational or we'd all be dead instead of meeting up for peace talks."

"I know, I know. I just...I don't like going in blind, Chris. I hate the uneasy feeling it gives me."

"I feel it too, but what choice do we have? This is for our families; for whats left of our species. We need to be strong for them."

"Yeah. You're right, I'm just really paranoid."

"We could use that. In this situation, you can't be too careful. Anyway, Kip- have you worked out what we're going to do about communication when meeting them?"

"Kinda. It's hard, because we don't know what tech they have- they could jam any electronics we have, or have something that detects them immediately...either way, we have to try. Going in blind is simply not an option. We need audio *and* video, for sure. If discussion fails, the footage of their ships, behavioral patterns, anything at all could come in handy. I think one tiny camera/mic assembly hidden on you is our best option. You have an ear piercing, right?" He pulled out a small, clear-crystal jewel, handing it to me.

I took a close look at it. "Clever, it just looks like jewelry. The video quality is acceptable?"

"Yep, tested it earlier. There aren't any facets cut into the stone, so the shot isn't skewed or anything. It can hold 48 hours of video, but that's a compressed file and won't look great. It's mainly a streaming device, which Ly should be recording down at HQ as well. I also have a tiny speaker, seriously, it's the size of a termite, and it goes *inside* you eardrum. This way, we can contact you directly."

Lyla and I both agreed that it was a good option, and I placed the jewel into my ear. "Do I look pretty?"

"You're a very pretty lady." Ben had snuck up behind Ly, who immediately freaked out.

"Damn it, Ben! Get the hell out of here! Bring me a coffee, while you're at it, since you bothered me."

I laughed as Ben ran out of the room. "Thank God for that kid. He really helps us remember who we were before all this started." Kip agreed and couldn't help but laugh a little himself, even Wallace smiled a little though his eyes seemed to stare beyond the projector's screen.

Several more hours were spent going over possible scenarios, topics to bring up, responses to certain questions, etc. I also practiced smooth ways to kill time- If anything seriously major that we hadn't gone over were to happen, I'd need to kill the transmission's three to four second round trip, plus a little time for Ly to think about it it. It was a slight pain in the ass, but ultimately, we decided that it was too dangerous to bring her along; if *anything* went wrong, Earth needed her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**April 21st, 2083**

"Test, test, 1, 2, 3. Can you hear me?" Kip's voice blared through the internal speaker in my ear.

"Yeah, but could you turn it down a little? It's a way too loud," I responded, recoiling in pain. "How's my voice coming through?"

"Sounds OK, the tiniest bit grainy but that's to be expected. How's this, any better?"

"Yeah, that's perfect. You promise they won't be able to hear this thing going off in my ear?"

Kip came back into the transmission room, where Lyla was eating a bowl of oatmeal on the big screen. "Don't worry about that, the speaker basically aims sounds into your ear canal so it needs very little volume. Unless these guys have a sense of hearing over five times better than us, they won't notice a thing."

"Okay. Good. I think I'm ready, guys." I took a deep breath to reassure myself.

Ly took a few seconds to finish her bite of oatmeal, then chimed in. "I think we're all set here. Kip?"

"Good here, too. I'm getting a solid feed from Chris to my personal station here, I'm going to begin transferring it to you guys now."

"Alright, do it." She took another bite of oatmeal, chewing slowly, then dropped her spoon and began trying to cheer with a closed mouth. "We're getting both audio and video, it looks great. Excellent work, Kip."

"I try. Well, let's get this show started. Chris, you feel okay? Wallace told me he's ready to go when you are."

My eyes were closed, breath regulated and body stilled to calmly solidify my resolve. I sat in silence, eradicating all fear and doubt to keep my mind as clear as humanly possible.

"I'm ready," I said, eyelids peeling apart slowly. "Let's get this done."

Kip and I floated through padded hallways toward a small airlock chamber, where Wallace was waiting for me. "I have your suit here, sir. When you're geared up, we'll take off."

With the *click* of my helmet sealing in place, Wallace and I stepped into the airlock and Kip returned to his little contact station. His voice crackled through as we set foot into a small 'lifeboat' ship- it was originally created to go on small rescue missions without wasting fuel reserves to relocate the entire main hull, but suited our purposes nicely. We were able to quickly get to the moon without endangering Kip's relay station and the ship that would take us home.

I noticed a small, worn photo pinned to the ceiling above Wallace's head. It was a little girl, probably seven or eight years old- not much younger than Sam.

"Is that your daughter?" He looked at me, and I pointed at the picture.

"Yeah, sweet thing," he said with a soft smile that slowly faded. "She didn't survive the attacks. Somehow still finds a way to inspire me in the face of fear."

I put a hand on his shoulder. "What was her name?"

"Sarah. Just like her mother."

"Beautiful name. Let's end this conflict, for Sarah."

As we landed on the Moon's surface, both Wallace and I were awestruck with what we saw: massive, almost organic-looking structures that were presumably ships, but the size of skyscrapers. Spiky, greenish-black and pulsating with a faint glow, they looked to be alive. I gulped at the sight of just how much power they seemed to hold. Though I knew they'd have incredible technology, nothing prepares a person to see such things up close.

I climbed out of the ship, turning to Wallace. "Stay here, on standby. Hopefully it won't come to this, but we might need to make a quick run for it."

"Understood. Godspeed."

I approached the massive structures, and sure enough, several of them came out to greet me. *Every bit as disgusting as the one we have down on Earth.* They were an off-putting mix of purple and brown, somewhat slimy and not even slightly humanoid. Their 'eyes' were more akin to those of a fly, compound and seemingly scaly, bulging heavily from the center of their bodies. Overall, their shape was conical, standing approximately seven feet tall on average, with six thick legs that fired up and down almost like fleshy pistons. Above the eyes, the narrowing three or four feet of their body could split into appendages at will, acting almost like tentacles used to grab or latch onto things. Overall...not a pleasant sight.

One of them stood in front of the rest, which I assumed to be their leader, and had some sort of device strapped to the skin above its eyes- the same one our prisoner had. 

"I assume you are a human, and that our message to you was received," a rough, computerized voice asked me.

"That is correct. My name is Chris Hestor. How can you hear me talking?"

"I have tuned this device to pick up your suit's radio signal."

"You work fast, then. Shall we proceed inside?"

"Inside? There is no need for that. We shall have this brief discussion here."

*I guess it's not surprising these guys have shit manners.*

"Sure, that's fine by me. Brief, though? I'd expected a rather long series of diplomatic talks to work out a massive amount of detail needed to lay out some kind of peace agreement."

"Brevity is adequate."

"All right. By the way, how do you know our language?"

"I will be the one asking questions. Do not interrupt me." The flesh above its eyes twitched slightly, which put me on guard.

"All right, sorry. Go ahead."

"Why do you humans love that rock so much?"

"Are you talking about Earth?"

"Yes. The planet you live on."

"Ah, well I suppose that's a little hard to explain. Its just our nature; Earth is our home, and to humans, protecting our home is very important. It's in our nature to fight for what we love."

"I see. Despite how little of it is left now, you still wish to keep it?"

"Well, yes. It's not completely gone, and it's still our home. We rebuild in the wake of destruction."

"I see. So you would fight if we tried to take Earth from you."

"Yes." A few seconds later, I hear Ly recoil at my answer. She always told me not to come off as combative, but on this issue I was unyielding.

It inched a little closer to me. "30,000."

I laughed a little, nervously. "What?"

"According to our scanners, that is how many members of your species survived our attack. Roughly."

*Is he trying to provoke me? Why?*

A voice crackled into my ear- it was Ly. "Stay calm, Chris. Don't let them get a rise out of you, that can't possibly end well. They could be testing your patience."

I looked straight at the hideous, sinewy tree stump and quelled all rising emotion. "Yeah, there aren't many of us left. Is there any particular reason you brought up that number?"

"You understand how few humans are left, yet you would stand firm in protecting that measly planet? It seems to be madness."

"Then I am mad."

There was a pause of eerie silence, the two of us staring at each other. *I can't read those eyes at all. They just look...empty.*

"Chris, they probably communicate through thought or something similar. That's why they keep stopping in silence, and would explain why only the ones with those boxes on them can talk," Lyla whispered into my ear.

The alien broke our quiet staredown. "Human, you have proven quite entertaining thus far. I have made my decision."

I cocked my head, confused. "Decision?"

"Yes. You are full of emotions and deep thought, far more so than than I ever imagined. You are a highly complex being."

*Oh, thank God.*

Its appendage split in twain, each one wrapping around me so tightly I thought my bones would grind to dust, lifting me into the air above it. I just barely managed to force a scream into my radio. "Wallace, get out of here! *Now!*"

Without hesitation, he took off and started soaring away from the Moon's surface. My heart sank as something massive protruded from the strange, glowing tower and seemed to amass a blinding white light at its tip. *What...what is this power? What are we up against?*

In the blink of an eye, the light had faded and a scream pierced through my radio before abruptly cutting off an instant later. I was rotated to face the fireball erupting where Wallace once was, searing hot debris scattering in every direction, careening with incredible velocity.

"Chris? Chris? What the fuck is going on? What was that explosion just now?" Ly's voice pierced through my ear.

"Why? Why...did you ask us to come here, only to attack? What about everything you just said to me? There was a man, as complex as I am, in that ship you destroyed...why?"

"Oh, shit...no, NO!" I heard Ly slam her fist into something.

"Yes, human, what I said was indeed true. It is your complexity, your depth and emotion, that will make you so much fun to torment. It has been eons since I last felt such pleasure...you will also become a threat to us if left to thrive and further evolve. I believe the expression you would use is 'two birds with one stone'."

"You faked peace talks to capture one of us, because it's *fun*? What the *fuck* is wrong with you?" I was screaming my voice raw, completely wild with rage over Wallace's meaningless death. I didn't even care about my predicament, I was so wracked with anger.

"We called you here to determine your complexity. I might've just left, plagued with monotonous boredom, if you were a duller, simpler being...but you, you make existing worth the time and energy. Seeing your wrath, fear and sorrow has kindled in me a joy once long forgotten. For that, I thank you."

I could do nothing but cry, helpless and alone, as they carried me through pulsating doors and into the biggest ship.

"I'm so sorry, Chris. I'm...I'm so, so sorry." I could tell Lyla was crying as well, though she tried to hide it.

Through watery eyes' distortion, I watched as the mangled core of Wallace's lifeboat flipped and danced through space, slowly shrinking in the distance. *I'm sorry, too. I let your dad die, Sarah.*

Darkness slowly swallowed me, my mind swirling in a blur of fear and failure. Faintly, I heard Ly shouting at everyone back in HQ. I was almost glad to be the prisoner, knowing how hard she was going to work the crew.

"Call the Commander in Chief *right now*. Wallace Grimm has been killed in action. Chris Hoster is still alive, but has been taken captive. We need to bring him home."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**April 22nd, 2081**

"Do you see Dad anywhere?" Sam asked, pointing into the night sky.

"No, sweetie. I don't think we'll be able to see him from down here."

They were standing outside, gazing at the glowing, grey rock with wonder. *I hope you're okay, love,* Beth thought, her deep blue eyes scattering moonlight across their surface.

She noticed dust kicking up on the road and heard tires crunching against gravel and sand- a car approached, blinding them with bright light, and a woman stuck her head out of the driver's window.

"Beth, it's Lyla Brennan. You guys need to come with me. I can wait a little if you need to pack, but please hurry."

"Lyla? What's going on?" She started feeling nervous, since it was very unlike Lyla to leave a workplace until everything was finished.

"Please, just hurry. I'll explain when we get there."

Beth packed some snacks and clothes for herself and Sam, as well as his inhaler. Once they climbed into the black SUV, Beth would no longer accept indirect answers.

"Lyla, why are you here?"

"Your presence is required at the Pentagon. We'd like to update you on the situation."

Sam chimed in, giddy. "Did daddy beat the aliens?"

"Quiet for a moment, Sam. I need to ask Ms. Lyla a question. Lyla, why are *you* here? That's what I meant. Why isn't James or someone else picking us up?"

Lyla gripped her steering wheel, the leather squeaking almost as if it were in pain. "I needed a break."

When they arrived at the Pentagon, Ben greeted them and pulled Sam aside to play with some toys set up as a distraction. With Sam out of the equation, Lyla opened up.

"I'm so sorry, Beth. It all happened so fast..." She began to choke on her words, trying not to cry.

"Oh, God...Ly, please just tell me, is my husband dead?"

"Wh- no, no I'm sorry, it's just been a rough day...he's been taken captive by the alien race that asked to meet us. Wallace, however...the ship he was piloting got shot down."

Beth's hand reached out to stifle a gasp. "Jesus...have they said anything? Is Chris a hostage? I don't understand, why would they even need leverage?"

Lyla's eyes remained fixed on the floor, as if the solution to her problems lied in the tile. "There is no reason. They just wanted to take as prisoner for the fun of it."

"...*Excuse me*? No, there has to be a reason. Did the talks go badly? Are you trying to cover up your own bullshit right now? Wh-"

"Please. I'm already breaking...they didn't want to talk. They just killed Wallace and took him prisoner, saying they hadn't encountered emotional beings in a long time and wanted to enjoy his pain."

Beth paused for a moment. "How do you know he's still alive?"

"The feed hasn't been cut, they must've overlooked the earring."

"Let me talk him."

"I can't, not right now."

"God damn it Lyla, you let me talk to my-"

"Beth...I can't let you. Give me a couple hours, okay? I wanted to bring you here so you'd be ready when he is."

Beth clenched her jaw, breaths getting quicker and hands trembling. "Okay. I'm going to check on Sam. Please get me when I can see my husband."

Lyla walked into the main office, which was being used as the makeshift HQ for this mission. Because Kip's setup operated outside of NASA's network system, Lyla was able to remain where her work and numerous advisors were within reach. She sat down at a chair, next to General Cory McAdams, who assumed leadership of all military operations once Earth was sent into disarray. He was staring intently at the screen, angered and disturbed.

"No military training, but that man is a fucking soldier."

Lyla turned her eyes to the screen, immediately shying away.

"Chris, can you hear me?" she asked softly, trying not to shock me.

My voice was weak and raspy, but I could muster enough strength to talk for the moment. "Yeah. They're gone, I think that's it for today. All I know about this place is that there's gravity, oxygen and plenty of shit to kill someone with."

Blood trickled down me, like streams trailing down and criss-crossing from almost every part of my body. The tools they used were indescribable, and the pain was as well. It got to a point where any new wounds were a blessing to help me forget how much everything else hurt.

The alien leader returned from its recess, stopping without grabbing anything new to tear into me.

"Sorry about all this," it said, staring straight into my soul. "I needed to confirm something, and I have. You see, this activity is quite the norm for us, and it's grown dull. I've had a go at you, and it has brought me no joy. Nothing like what I felt when your ship was destroyed and liquid poured from your eyes as you trembled with anger."

I coughed up a little blood onto the floor in front of him, refusing to acknowledge his prattling with words of my own.

"Well, point being that you don't need to worry about this pain continuing. We will heal your wounds sufficiently as I have something far more entertaining planned. First, I must learn a little of your mind."

"I'm not telling you shit."

"You do not need to." He broke off an appendage, slamming it into my head. The point of contact felt searing hot, like it were fire itself, and thankfully it was removed after several seconds.

"Beth and Sam. You love them very much, yes?"

My strength was drained, but with what little was left, I raised my head and stared right into his disgusting compound eyes. "If you even think of touching my family, you slimy cunt, I will rip whatever sack of shit you have in place of a heart right out."

"Yes, yes, that is the emotion which makes you so valuable...wrath, I love seeing the wrath in your eyes. We will begin a fun game, then. I will give you one revolution of your planet to decide."

"You can shove your decisions up whatever hole you have."

"Your choices are as follows: either these two you love most will fly here where we will force you to watch them suffer-"

"I will fucking kill you. Mark my words, I will *fucking kill you*."

"-or your entire planet will be reduced to ash. Every human, every animal and every plant. 80% of our fleet is stationed here, approximately twice the distance from your planet as its moon. If you refuse, there's a fair chance not even the planet itself will survive. I have seen images of them through your memories, so if you try to pass others off as the two you love, I will force you to fire the weapons that destroy Earth yourself."

I couldn't form words. My brain felt like it'd explode at any moment, burning with rage and fear unlike anything I'd ever known. I could only manage and weak croak in response, and the alien had already left. Another entered, healing my mangled flesh and burnt skin, yet even as the stinging nerves slowly stopped screaming...

Nothing could heal the crippling pain in my mind.

**April 23rd, 2081**

My eyes burned before they even opened, despite how dark it was in my cell. I'd cried all night, locked in some kind of box cut off from everything going on around me.

"Chris, can you hear me? I don't think I can hold your wife back any longer. Talk to her."

"Sure," I lifelessly responded.

I could hear Beth shouting, getting closer and closer. "Chris? Chris? Why is the screen blacked out? Chris, are you there?"

"I'm here." My voice was weakened and frail, like my body...and my spirit.

"Thank God, love, oh thank God...they wouldn't let me talk to you, so I thought you had died." 

*I wish I had.* "What have they told you?"

"Not much, just that you've been captured and they're hurting you. Are you okay?"

"Yeah, they patched me up for some reason. How's Sam?"

"He's good, Ben's playing with him. He misses you. I miss you."

"I miss you too. Put Ly back on, would you? I need to talk to her about something."

"Sure. I love you." I could hear her voice breaking.

"I love you too," I whispered back.

"Chris, Beth is out of the room. Any ideas? General McAdams is here, and so is James. Kip is listening in."

"McAdams, please tell me you have some kind of spaceship that can fight."

"This ain't Star Wars, kid. We don't have that technology. Besides, what could one ship do to an entire fleet? We'd be destroyed before anything even left the atmosphere. A fight is simply impossible, son. I'm sorry."

I slammed my fist against some kind of wall. "God damn it..."

"What about fakes? I have plenty of soldiers that would gladly die to save the world," McAdams suggested.

"That won't work. They dipped into my memories, and saw their faces. The alien said if I try to trick them, they'll make me push the button to destroy the planet myself. Maybe I can break out of here and kill their leader..."

"Chris, you only have a few hours left. What...what if we can't come up with a plan quickly enough?" Lyla was hesitant to ask, but everyone else was thinking it.

"I have to make something work. I...I won't let my family go through hell for the amusement of some intergalactic psychopath. I'll kill him." I began to push against the walls with all my might, trying to pry it open with force. My legs burned and the skin on my fingers peeled as I took every ounce of rage out on my cage. Suddenly, I burst through it.

*Holy shit, I did it!*

An alien immediately smashed  my head so hard I felt a tooth rattle around in my mouth, and my body careened backwards into the pit I was locked in. They'd noticed me making a commotion and opened the lid to knock me out.

When I came to, Lyla's screams were echoing in my ear canal. "Chris! Chris, God damn it! *Wake up, you idiot!*"

"My head feels like it's going to explode...what happened?"

"They knocked you out. You've been unconscious for several hours now. Chris...I think we're out of time. I'm sorry-"

"If you'll pardon the interruption, I'll take it from here. Son, you're you're a hero. Your bravery is unmatched and will never be forgotten," General McAdams spoke firmly into the microphone. He sounded like a politician giving a speech on live television. "However, we can't possibly justify compromising the safety of everyone left on Earth just to save your family. I'm sorry, son, but they're just too much for us to handle. We have no choice."

My body trembled, and I started hyperventilating. "No...no, no, no..."

"Chris, it's Lyla. Please, please try to understand-"

"*NO*! **NO**! You can't...is this all we're worth? This is our limit? To be sheep, sacrificial offerings to a cruel, angry God? This is my family, for fuck's sake...please, there has to be something I can do."

I yelped in pain as light flooded my eyes, searing my retinas. The alien leader, signified by the box on his chest, lifted me into the air.

"Tell me your answer."

I cried, and choked, trying to come up with words of refute, kicking at it aimlessly. I managed nothing.

"Chris...no matter what, you have to tell him we'll send Sam and Beth. If you don't, we all die right now. Please, Chris." Ly was desperate, knowing the world's fate rested in the hands of a broken man.

"Some time ago, you asked me how I learned your language. Before you had spacecraft, I sent one of us down to learn about your species. Instead of doing actual work, he brought me a man, just like you, who loved his family and his home. From him, I learned language, and I learned of how complex your species truly is. However, he broke easily. In the end, he begged for death, and just cried endlessly without humoring my games. Don't bore me as he did, or I will do unthinkable things far worse than what I've already suggested."

"Chris, this is General McAdams. Look, son, even if you don't want to admit it, your family will die if you defy them along with everyone else down here. Don't doom humanity, I know you understand deep down in your gut that this is the only way."

Weak, broken and completely lifeless, I hung in the air, suspended by the alien's grasp. I just barely managed to force the words out through tears. "My family. They'll send my family here."

"Good. I see, the world is too much a price for sparing your family years of torture. Yet, you almost considered it, didn't you? You almost let everyone else die just to spare them the pain."

My muscles convulsed, spasming as I lost control of my body. It's hard to explain just how much a man breaks when he realizes how helpless he is in the face of a greater power that whips him around like a toy, playing with the lives of those he loves most dearly.

"Here is your suit radio. Contact the ship you came from and tell them that your family must leave the planet's atmosphere by the time it's rotated twice."

"Two days," I weakly responded, "is not enough time. I don't even think we can get the flight ready by then..."

"Make it work."

"Jesus, Chris, the effort it takes to get a flight ready...we won't even have time to think if we have to ship them out in 48 hours. The ship might just explode because we can't inspect it properly. And to find a good pilot willing to accept a likely death...please, please buy us more time," Ly begged me.

"Look, two days just isn't-"

I was thrown into a box again, where I promptly vomited everywhere, violently sobbing with gut-wrenching power that shook my entire body. *How can I be so useless?*

I passed out to the sound of Ly shouting my name.
