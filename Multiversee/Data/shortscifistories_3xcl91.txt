Whatever happens
tretos
It was a beautiful night, clear sky. 

They were lying on the sand listening to the sea, watching the stars.  

An Easter Island - place far enough to find yourself. 

 - Stars never change - he said, lying next to her. 
 - Even a thousand years is not enough for that - she quietly replied after a pause. 
 - Yes, it's a fraction of nothing in the universe. 

Few minutes of silence. 

 - We change... and we changed. 
 - Yes, very true. 
 - We need a break, we need a change. 
 - Yes, where you will go - He said after minute. 
 - haven't been home for some time, you? 
 - My plans to live in Japan never happened, but now its possible. 
 - Now it's the time - she said and looked at the sea. 
 - When shall we meet again ? - he asked and sat down looking at her. 
 - Here in five hundred years, whatever happen. 
 - Here, whatever happens. 

They left the next morning in opposite directions.
