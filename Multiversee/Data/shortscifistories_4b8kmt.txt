The plasma beam strikes the man in the head, boiling his flesh and evaporating his blood, melting his skin, leaving partially uncovered skull beneath. 

When the temperature drops below blood evaporating point, a stream of blood comes out of his remaining arteries painting the ground which he fell on in purple-red.

As the alien invader, the killer of the soldier, approaches his limp body he uses his long elevated nose to sense if there were any more of his kind in the area.
After a while, he figures out the area is safe and proceeds to absorb the dead body.

His digestive track completely engulfs the raw meat in soup of highly acidic stomach fluids.

Slowly through membranes of his cells, critical nutrients are received and alien suddenly feels well fed. He then lays down and falls asleep.
