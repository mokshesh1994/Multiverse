[OC] Impermanent

Immortality

As the eons passed her by the changing seasons swirled around her like wisps of mist, impermanent and insubstantial. Leaves fell and new growth bloomed, and after a while it stopped mattering; nothing really changed. Trees towered over her and rivers flowed, but if She closed her eyes for a moment they were gone, lost to the steady progression of time.

&nbsp;

When the world was still young She had marvelled at the rise of trees, piercing into the sky tall and proud. She watched with bated breath the desperate contests between predators and prey. Struggling and energetic these sights seemed at first so important, but as She watched life around her repeat itself again and again She saw its futility. Sometimes the predator was victorious and the prey was ripped apart and sometimes the prey escaped and the hunter starved, either way the world kept spinning, indifferent.

&nbsp;

When they first appeared She talked to them, seeking out their most powerful leaders and their greatest thinkers. She sat around their crackling campfires and walked alongside them as they traversed the world She had long travelled alone. She laughed with them and sang their songs, revelling in their novelty and their ambition; their drive to change their world. But as time passed She began to despair as it became clear to her that their accomplishments were no more lasting than the seasons or the tides: their conquests fell, their works turned to dust and even their songs were, in time, forgotten. 

&nbsp;

As new generations arose they repeated the same patterns as those that went before laughing and playing, striving and toiling. But in this She could find no joy, as She was again alone; surrounded by fleeting figures drifting through the world, insubstantial and leaving nothing in their wake. She watched from a distance as the achievements of men faded into the same patterns of the world She had for so long known. Ghosts in the mist.

&nbsp;

As the centuries passed ice sheets expanded across the land and mankind huddled in their caves and tents, small and vulnerable as the ice wiped away the world that their ancestors had known. But as She watched the ice sheets retreated those that lived in its wake began to struggle and laugh anew. They gathered in greater numbers than the tribes of old and settled; working together to build huts and dig up the land. From a distance She watched again, daring to hope, as humans scurried about for their short lives building communities. But her fears came to pass, as floods and famines swept away mans fledgling cities. Leaving empty buildings to decay like the rotting hulks of the great trees, whose rise and fall She had long ago watched.

&nbsp;

And yet they tried, time and time again they built their walls and ploughed their fields, trying to impose their will on the world. She wept in the face of such futility and turned away, traveling the wildernesses and deserts, places where, even these days, humanity rarely travelled.

&nbsp;

As She reached the edge of the desert She found herself at the outskirts of a city, as large as any She had seen before.

&nbsp;

She stood at the base of a massive monument of hewn stone, taller than the hills and the great trees. Its sloping sides of smooth limestone stretched into the sky. A new mountain built by the labour of men.

&nbsp;

Immortality.
