**What is power? Power is a beautiful thing. It is incorporeal, ethereal and indescribable. It is a gem so great that all creatures reach for it, without truly knowing the true nature of their goal. Then again, why should we know the truth about power? It is everything.** 

The spectre Emperor Sephrael silently ghosted through the corridors of the countless vessels within the fleet, not a single soul capable of perceiving his movement. His gaze shifted through the crew that passed by, sometimes through his avatar. Anxiety tingled throughout this entire fleet. Helmsmen sweated behind their controls while gunners swallowed behind their stations. Captains nervously seated themselves within their chairs as their fingers dug deeply within leather armrests. 

**Fear is power manifested within its second most influential form. Fear is what drives men to hide behind walls and towers. It is the howl in the night that sends soldiers to arms, children weeping to their mothers and kings fortifying their castles. Its what had brought humanity together time and time again. Fear, of something greater, of something unknown, of something malevolent.** 

The Emperor stalked through the corridors of this plane of existence. The smell of resentment, bitterness and cold fury flared into his senses, a ghostly spectre grinned, its presence purged doubt and uncertainty. Anxiety was cleansed. Everyone that Sephrael stood by was cured of agitation, and inoculated with unbridled antipathy toward the manipulators that stolen their parents, grandparents and their families. 

**And it is here, that fear washes away. Fear itself only remains as the water that nourishes the seed. Fear is the first catalyst to many passions. Sometimes, it leads to despair and finally, collapse. Other times, it allows for the most influential forms of power to arrive. Hope. 
The power of fear is never fear itself, its the concept of overcoming ones terror, ones apprehension and ones weakness. This is hope. When hope finally overtakes fear, the soul is impassioned with a host of different feelings.** 

The Emperors ghostly hand gently laid upon the pilot of an interceptor. A rookie pilot, where in this dark age, the recruits typically remained within the single digits in terms of age. With a gentle pat on the shoulder, the Emperor listened to the soothing of a heartbeat and the stilling of shaking hands. Moving through the astral plane of space, Sephrael seated his avatar close to the interceptor which rode at the head of the human armada. 

**Here is the result of conquered fears. After years of being purged of all self-doubt, worry and hardened against the tongues of stress. This is what hope wrings. If it is not the ascension of joyful pride, it is the advent of bitter hatred. A simple and deep understanding that ones fears was the enemy. And like all enemies, they could be conquered and destroyed.** 

The Emperors omniscient eyes stayed by the fleet as it jumped into FTL arrived all the way to their area of operations. Azzenthia Station was an important port within Erian space. Not only was it responsible for countless merchant shipping lanes, it was also a key military production site where ships would nest in its drydocks and where vessels would be built within its factories. An attack here would be a catastrophic blow to both the Erian military and economy. 

**Look at how powerful these foolish aliens thought themselves to be. To not even place defenses on such a key outpost within this sector of space. To believe that within their cradles of fortune, they truly are safe from anything in this universe. Watch, as how mere children prove them to be terribly wrong.**

A barrage of missiles came from the human fleet. Hundreds of these projectiles flew in zig-zag patterns at toward their targets. Within moments, Azzenthia station was aflame. Hundreds of hulls creaked and groaned within their drydocks as they broke apart and died. Several stations were knocked straight out of their orbits, some were shattered into space dust, others were condemned to fall fast and hard into the planet they had orbited around. In mere moments, tens of thousands of Erians had either met death from exposure to the void or from incineration at the barrage of ordinance. 

**The arrogance of these Erians is sickening. The way they thought they were safe and protected. They way they assumed that no force could ever challenge them, not even the very people they used as shields to fight their war. But now, they can see how wrong they truly were. Finally, as their former puppets rise against them, they find that they are ultimately powerless as undeserved pride and false confidence provide no protection against the guns of those whom they have deceived.** 

There was an unprecedented way to how the human fleet moved and operated. Those who received feed of this battle scarcely could comprehend the military precision and perfect unison which the human armada operated under. The generations of war against a savage enemy had made humanity sharper, deadlier and more keen than ever. Perhaps deep down, almost a century-long war had finally awaken the deep malevolence that nested in every human, driving them into this frenzy of furious retribution. 

It was a perfect mixture of brutality and intelligence. Brutality that had been commonplace in the Horde that humanity was used to fight had forced humans to revert to savage means of defeating their enemies. Intelligence that had been much needed to win over impossible odds when used against a foe that was poorly prepared for battle seemed impossible. 

As the ships of the Erians were shattered in space. As the paltry resistance that they mounted was crushed, a bitter race gleefully watched the preamble to the countless loses the aliens would suffer in this war. 

The human armada pushed onwards. This was only going to be the beginning. From the beyond, a hidden spectator let out a rapturous chuckle as he watched humanity gaining its rightful place within this universe.
