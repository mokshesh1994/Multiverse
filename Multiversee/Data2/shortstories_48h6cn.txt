     Howard was freezing in bed after a long day of drinking. Some days you could drink and drink and drink and not get drunk just get a blistering headache like a vice. This was okay. Howard dug on pain. He thrived on it. Misery loves company and Howard loved misery. Depression was Howard's best and only friend. But he was cold and hungry and thirsty so he got out of his freezing bed and went to the "frigerator. Popped a cold one and got a can of chili from the cabinet and opened it. Howard found the cleanest spoon in the sink and started chewing on raw chili and grease backing it up with beer. Passing gas on his way back to his bed there was a knock on the door. After Howard had got back back on the bed the knock was repeated louder. A staccato tattoo on Howard's throbbing skull. 
     Howard swung the door open and there she stood. He invited her in and cleared away some trash and dirty laundry so she could sit. "Been a while." 
     "Yeah."
     He hadn't seen her in two years but you really couldn't blame him, or her. After they fucked they lay in the semi-dark, smoking cigarettes. "Has it really been two years?"
     "Yeah."
     They were both the same just a little worse. They each knew it and knew they each knew it. Howard also knew she'd probably want to sleep there. "Listen, baby." says Howard. "you can't stay here tonite."
     "I understand, Howard."
     She got dressed and left. They didn't kiss or embrace. She just left. Howard finished his chili and opened another beer. On the way back to bed there was a loud knocking on the door. It was gonna be a long night.
