In my first year of teaching a number of years ago (aged 22) we had a sex/health ed program that ran for about 6 weeks and was taught by a nurse. I was teaching grade 6 (11 and 12 year olds). In the first lesson the nurse decided to ask the kids a question, her idea of asking this question was 'to get the silliness' out of the kids from the beginning. Me, siting at my desk one eye on what was going on in the discussion and the other reading the paper. My ears soon pricked up when I heard the nurse ask the question, after she wrote the word 'vagina' on the white board, "who can tell me if they know any other words that people use instead of the word 'vagina'?" The next five minutes was a massive awkward learning experience about what these kids new!! It started off pretty tame as the nurse quickly wrote the names down around the word 'vagina' like 'vag', 'fanny' 'front bottom' etc,... then the ball got rolling. I almost fell off my chair when the kids put their hands up (well taught) and started coming out with words like 'pussy', 'gash', 'clunge', 'muff'. I looked at the nurse, with a look of 'it should probably stop there look', but unfortunately it's didn't... Hands went up, and uncomfortable for me, the names kept coming... 'axe wound', 'snatch', 'clam', 'bearded oyster', I finally politely put a stop to it after the name 'meat wallet' was used!  I couldn't believe it, I was well out of touch because I hadn't heard of half the names used. Most shocked that these words were coming from the mouths of 11 and 12 year olds (mainly boys) The nurse thought it was pretty funny and thought it was a good effort, the kids thought it was hilarious also! Then penis got written on the white board.... The joys of being a teacher!
