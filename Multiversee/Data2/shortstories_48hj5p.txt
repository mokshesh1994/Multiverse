You can sleep in my bed with me, he said, Ive got a big one. 
    Well if you're sure, she said. She needed a place to sleep because all the couches and chairs in the house were taken by fallen comrades who partied as long as they could. 
       So that's how he ended up lying in his own bed with his eyes closed trying not to think about the beautiful girl in her underwear sleeping inches away from him. He was trying not to think about reaching out into the darkness to touch her pale skin. Then he was trying not to think about the stiffening between his legs, trying not to think about how he could hear her breathing in the silence.
        That was when her breathing changed. She made a soft hmph noise in her sleep and moved a bit closer to him. Her next breath was long, deep, and raspy. She squirmed a bit and let out another soft squeak. He could feel her flesh move against his. Her breathing became heavy and fast. Part of him thought she might be having a nightmare, the other part couldn't think at all. Her breathing kept getting faster. His heart began to throb in his chest and his breath was catching in his throat. He peered through the darkness at the back of her head wondering if she was still sleeping. 
     She let out a soft moan that sent an immediate heat to his crotch. She began to writhe in a way, her hips shifting slightly, but erratically. Thoughts raced through his mind. He wanted to touch her. He wondered if he should wake her up. Would that be the polite thing to do? Her breathing kept getting faster, harder. Another moan made him fully erect. More moans, more heavy breathing and the writhing of her hips covered more area, moving back and forth. Moving faster now, back and forth. Finally with one last loud moan and a sudden arch in her back, she was still and the dark silence returned. He finally fell asleep not long after that, with a large wet spot on the front of his underwear.
