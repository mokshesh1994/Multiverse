There was never nothing. Just nothing could not exist. Something must have always existed. Before time and space, before heat and cold, before the dark and the light. There was only The Source, and within its void darkness developed. To balance the darkness The Source developed light but there was no dimension within the void. The dark and the light eternally intertwined. Forever will there always be light within the darkest zone. As there will always be a shadow within the brightest zone. To stop further loss The Source created space but it was empty and vast. Nothing could move within the space. To balance this The Source developed time. Now the dark and the light could travel freely threw this new place. Once the dark and the light reached every rim of space The Source came to realization how vast this area was and how empty. To balance this The Source developed a Base Particle. The Base Particle was spread to every rim of space but it just sat there lifeless. To balance this The Source gave it movement, vibration. As a reaction The Base Particle changed in form. Gases and solids started to develop. Which soon formed dark and light stars. Other solids began taking shapes of meteorites. Some stars were so large they pulled nearby meteorites towards them. Various meteorites crashed into one another. Forming large surfaces that had pull of there own. These enormous forms of mass began orbiting stars. As more things started to change and form in space The Source still felt empty, desolated, alone. It looked upon its oldest creations the dark and the light. Bestowing upon them a portion of its abilities. The dark and the light took conscious form.
