This was a final for one of courses in college, and the professor really enjoyed it. I figured I may try to give this thing a go, but I wanted to get some more feedback first. A few warnings though: I am still not great when it comes to grammar, and if there is a lot of mistakes I am sorry. I know it is annoying, and I am trying to fix it. Also, there is some references to the the actual project this was an assignment for. You can just ignore that stuff (it is only a sentence or two. I hope you all enjoy my first attempt at a story. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwo2KbhUnvPKFTrD0FYgz6N7oPNfx0-dKaoi-pxlGL4/edit?usp=sharing
