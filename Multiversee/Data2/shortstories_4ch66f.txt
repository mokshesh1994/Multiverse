Her real hair color was different. You could see it through the brown dye. She wore a jacket. Leather? I don't remember.

My teeth had been bothering me for a week. She had been bothering me about my teeth for a week. Her teeth weren't perfect, but were pretty. She was very pretty. I remember.

Our days off synced, so we went. I don't remember what day.

I get called into the dentist's office. She staysin the waiting room.

There were gunshots. More than three. Panic.
The police and paramedics were called in. They ushereveryone out of the clinic.

She runsback into the clinic, slipping past the cops.

She finds the body there--bloody. Weeps. Bawls.

Rush of cops into the clinic to retrieve her. Couldn't pull her away.

Someone grabs her.
Me.

Her--relieved, confused. Relieved.

I walkher out of the clinic,past policemen and onlookers.

Sheglances at me. Glancesagain.Making sure I was there. I hold her hand tighter to assure her I was.

She sits on the steps, I leanagainst a wall. (This store closed down months ago.)

She thought that was me--the man was dressed like me!But all a bloody mess.Oh god. She thought it was...

She smiles, teary-eyed.

I smileback.
I sigh.

It was me. Shot. More than thrice.

Her--shocked, confused. Confused.

They haven't found out yet, so I can stay. I have thirty minutes? I can stay. They always find out.They're very thorough. I have twenty minutes, maybe. Don't worry. I'll stay.

I hold her close as she weeps.

Onlookers stare at a girl, alone on the steps. Crying.
