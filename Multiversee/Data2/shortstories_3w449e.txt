Hello! A few things before the story. English isn't my first language and I've never written a story ever, so I don't know how to alternate between characters and an "outside" narrator and I'm not really that great at grammar. Please excuse all of these things if you notice them and sorry if it ruins the experience.

This was based on a similar event that happened to me very recently. Please enjoy!
> 
> Yep, I still don't know why I have this..
> 
> He said, looking at his logs from a chat file he'd saved with title Why do I have this.
> 
> As he continued scrolling down 11 months worth of daily conversation in his dark room. He read the various personal things he shared with her. He thought to himself again..
> 
> I miss having a person to talk to..
> 
> This wasn't the first time he thought of this, and certainly wasn't the last.
> 
> He had originally intended to just see if he had ever said the word love to her in a direct manner, but he was distracted by all the memories rushing back to him.
> 
> Fuck.. and it had to be just after an episode about losing your friends..
> 
> He said, with tears welling up in his eyes as he read along their conversations..
> 
> You, along with everyone else I knew through this game, are my only friends. I really appreciate all the great time I'm having with you right now. Thank you, for being my friend
> 
> Those words he said 4 months ago really shook him up, and as he wiped the tiny amount of tears in his eyes, he stood up.
> 
> Almost stumbling on the things laying about in his room, he slowly opened the door of his room and quickly passed by the people sitting around the TV laughing. Almost running into the bathroom to avoid yet another lecture from his roommates about how he never gets out of his room.
> 
> Quickly closing the door behind him, he looked into his own reflection and, as he always did when he was upset, started having a conversation with himself.
> 
> I am a different person from whoever I was 6 months ago, right?
> 
> If I was a character in a movie or a show, people would be raving about how good my character development is!
> 
> After watching that show, I know that life is worth living even when people around you hurt you
> 
> I know I can't kill myself or push everyone away from me. The only thing I can do just live
> 
> 
> I guess I've really changed since everyone I used to talk to left me
> 
> I wonder why..
> 
> 
> They say if you can't figure out who's the asshole in your class is then you're the asshole.
> 
> 
> There is no denying that I'm the reason everyone hates talking to me, right?
> 
> He sighed loudly, hoping no one heard him over the loud television, and finally said.
> 
> 
> Whatever happens.. happens..
> 
> Leaving the bathroom and going back into his room, he closes the document without fulfilling his original purpose. And begins the next episode of the show he was just watching.
