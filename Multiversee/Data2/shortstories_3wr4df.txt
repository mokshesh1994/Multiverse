To BW: Joyful, Delighting, Resenting

Chapter 2: Dreams

Everyone has always told me that they dream every night. What if I told you I never dream? Typically most nights are a blur of darkness with once in a blue moon I have visions of the future. I dont mean just I saw this person walk through a door vision most of mine are full detail or something I have to analyze to understand what will happen. I am typically never wrong so to me these dreams are nightmares of what is to come. Recently I found out that coffee before bed doesnt allow me to quickly enter REM sleep where you rarely dream due to being completely asleep. Coffee has allowed me to dream every night I decide to drink it before bed. I decided it would be a good idea to have coffee before bed just to see if I was right and I had vibrant dreams of the future. After reading into my dreams I decided to confront them head on and ask some questions to the person they were about. I was right The dreams told me exactly what I needed to know so when I asked the person Do you see a future with us? The reply was a simple No and that is ok. I knew it was coming and even though I cried my hardest that night a dear friend was still up to help me with it. Thanks

Thanks for reading and as always IBW!
