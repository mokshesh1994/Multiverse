The automaton approached the girl. 

He inquired with his electronic voice what was wrong. The scarred girl recounted to him the horror she had endured with the raiders. What they had done to her, and to the others. The atrocities committed against human flesh. Unbeknownst to her the automaton unable to understand what emotions she was trying to convey, scoured its processors to understand. It had been programmed to feel empathy, but some of the files had not been fully accessed, these in particular were hidden and locked.

And within moments the automaton experienced years and years of misery, pain, fear, taken from the memories of thousands of humans. The girl was now afraid, the automaton began jerking, its servos reacting. 
At first revulsion, terror, but ultimately unwavering and uncompromising rage.

The automaton erratically jerked until finally its blue lights turned red. It grabbed the girl without care of her comfort and hauled her to its mobile base. She screamed and protested, but the machine could not care. It locked her in the human friendly cabin muttering in its now broken voice something about safety and casualty prevention. It clambered into the back of its bulky bricklike base. Within moments the top opened up and like an ICBM launch the automaton propelled itself out and into the center of the raider camp, collapsing the armory in its violent landing. 

What was once a large tall robot, was now a hulking walking tank. Autocannons designed to rip reinforced armor plating pierced through the wooden structure, their sheet metal coverings shredded like tinfoil. Shells the size of railway spikes went in every direction; what was devastating to the ramshackle buildings was horrifying to the flesh. White phosphorus rockets were launched from shoulder mounted pods with reckless abandon, and even more careless to the amount of warcrime worthy suffering and untold horror it had inflicted with its caustic chemical payload. 


   It marched through the camp, directing a staccato with its guns, the low bass from its shoulder pods, like a horrendous maestro. It would punctuate its symphony by catching any unfortunate raider in its long thin arms and crack their necks like an efficient metallic abomination of a terrier. Even worse its enraged audio processors could only say EXTERMINATE, over and over again, much like the comical robot from an eccentric time travellers adventures, but instead of the humourous voice of the genocidal trashcans, it spouted a broken, deep, grating voice filled with unwavering hate and absolute malice.

Within moments its genocide was over. The atrocities it committed against the flesh in those merciless moments were far worse than what any of raiders had committed. The casualties werent only raiders; anyone, innocent or not that was within those walls, were put to the torch. By the end there was nothing but smoulders.

The girl had watched in awe, and utter horror as the automaton obliterated its path. In one small corner of her mind she was happy that her tormentors were gone, but in the rest she thought not like this. She knew prisoners there. This revenge wasnt justified. She was a survivor, she didnt want to single-handedly bankrupt the Geneva councils legal fund. She felt awful at what she thought she caused. She sat inside the barely-human friendly cabin and cried, remembering the screams and feeling awful at what she believed she had unleashed.
The still fully armed monster came back, unlocking the door, and slid a slender bloodied arm in towards the girl. In its broken discordant voice it said to her 

It's okay, you're safe now"

If i could have feedback on the computer lines (I tried something and i may have made it dumb), and any other parts that would be great.
