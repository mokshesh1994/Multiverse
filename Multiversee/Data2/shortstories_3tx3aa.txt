She was from Helsinki, she said, and visiting a friend for the weekend, and she didnt believe that I was American, probably because of my blue eyes and blonde hair. Even after I showed her my ID (mainly to convince her that I was 19 years old; she was 22 and I think didnt want to sleep with anyone that much younger than her), even then she kept up her charade, and teased and joked with me so much that I thought that she really wasnt interesteduntil she suggested that we take tequila shots. Still today Ive never known any clearer sign than that.

We left the club at midnight, when the hint of the sun was still visible if you looked away into the pines. Suburbanite Americans find cobblestone streets so romantic, even when they're bordered by apartments, our very antithesis.


She laughed when I couldn't figure out the wrapping on her European condoms.


I woke up at 3:30, because the sun was in my eyes. She still slept, so she must really have been Finnish. I wrote my number on an index card I found on her bureau, and left it on her floor in front of her door (inside her roomI was afraid that her roommate would remove it if I left it outside, the roommate who had only frowned at me). The room was a mess. How long had she been here, really?


Later, I would tell myself that she never called because I didnt prepend it with my country code. Id also remember that Finnish men had to join the military by age 22.


I biked back at 4:00, nearly ten miles, on the bicycle that I'd bought for 15, which had a chain that fell off every 800 meters or so. I got lost several times, and barely made it back in time to catch the van that took us students across the border to the Lappish research station. I wished that my Helsinki girl had been Sami, so that I could tell the van what Id done the night before. I decided that when the topic arose organically, I would name her Anja. I was pretty sure that was a Scandinavian name.
