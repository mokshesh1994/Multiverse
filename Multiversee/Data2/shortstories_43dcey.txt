Hellooo!!

Hi Faith! How was school?

Fine. 

Wanna play football in the yard?

No. (Faith is not in a great mood.)

Okay. I will go and water the goat.

(Faith looks at me, as if I'm some insanely crazy person.)

(But she seems excited about the idea - to water a goat.)

(I proceed to the yard, where I find the sunflower in its
relatively grand pot. Yesterday, I nested a small plastic 
goat in the soil in the pot to present this idea of watering 
a goat to Faith. Watering a goat is not a usual expression,
and I know, Faith is having a hard time at school. She
does not want to bother me with it, I think.)

(Faith is just behind me, as I water the plant. I pretend
not to have noticed her.)

I thought it was a real goat. Faith exclaimed.

Well, it is. It told me, it needed to be watered, and I don't
know why. 

Plastic goats do not need to be watered in my
oppinion. 

No, I would say so too.

Why are you watering it then?

Because of you, Faith.

You are so weird, Andrew. 

Well, you see, the goat said to me, that the sunflower cannot 
yet speak for itself, so it came here to tell me to water it. 

To water the goat? Do you expect me to believe that?

(I smiled at her, and she repaid my gesture with a lifted eyebrow.
Then I said)

Have faith.

(We broke out in laughter.)
