Once upon a time there was a dog and a cat.

The cat was called CattyCat and the Dog was called BillyBobDog.

CattyCat was red, she had big whiskers and missing ear.

BillyBobDog was black and white with a long tail and a big wet dog nose.

Unusually for cats and dogs, CattyCat and BillyBobDog were best friends and often went on adventures together.

One of their favourite adventures was to go in to the woods and play in the stream. It was a fact that CattyCat didn't actually enjoy getting wet but she thought that it would be good practise for if ever she was on a sinking ship. She liked to play things safe.

On one of their adventures CattyCat and BillyBobDog finished playing in the brook and decided that instead of going back home they would go further in to the woods. They soon came across a new path that they hadn't seen before. The path was overgrown and it didn't look like anyone went down it very often, however, some of the grass was trampled so at least one other person had been down there recently.

The woods was very quiet around here, CattyCat and BillyBobDog were used to hearing the sounds of the stream but as they walked further along the path the sound of the stream faded away. BillyBobDog became nervous when he realised that the birds had stopped singing. CattyCat also didn't like it very much because often when BillyBobDog was playing in the stream she would go off and chase some birds.

As they walked further along the path they reached a clearing, and in the middle of the clearing was a small cottage with a chimney, a small waft of smoke was rising from the chimney.

BillyBobDog noticed that outside the cottage door the owner had placed some items. He saw an axe, a spear and some rabbit traps. If he hadn't been colour blind he would have realised that the axe was covered in blood.

Still, he did not like the situation.

"Woof woof woof woof, woof" said BillyBobDog nervously.

"Meeeow meeow" CattyCat agreed. Afterall, she though, this seems like one of those situations that can get you killed, why get in to that?

So, reluctantly, they both went home and avoided the murderer in the woods.
