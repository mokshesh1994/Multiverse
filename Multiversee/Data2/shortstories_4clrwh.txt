A quick glance at his bromptometer told him everything he needed to know about human mating rituals: The last two remaining humans with AIDS... they bang. Then a robot jumps through the wall like the mu'fuggin Kool Ade(s) man and donkey punches both of them on the top of the melon wammy. "ouch" the man says, his shoulders beginning to slump in post-coital fatigue "what was that about?". "It is an impulse, a curse and a bug in my software. I do not understand my own proclivities" the robot said has his exo-shield retreated into his body. "Well", Miranda replied as she searched for a cold compress, "since we are all suffering from some sort of ailment or another, there is no reason we should keep Glen around. With the AIDS brand on top of my vagina, no other man would touch me. As a model K android, you can easily out-cock this ass-hat and fill my life with orgasmic wonder". Stunned, partially from the thunderous shock that Special K delivered to his cranium and partially from the incredulous comments by his long-time lover, Glen began to slowly creep backwards off the porch; his shirt readily soaking up the thick drops of the downpour. "And where in the flying frying pan fuck do you think you're going Glen?" K hissed while his bionic meat hammer lay momentarily dormant. K seized Miranda's left leg at the ankle and began violently smashing Glen with her entire body. The moment the beating ended, Glen took a dump.
