A short piece I did about a woman and unwanted advances, with heavy allusions to Shakespeare.

Do you like it? Is the syntax (parentheses, italics) too weird? Are Nadia's thoughts too choppy; is she not characterized enough?

Did I get across at the end that Nadia is worried that she'll never love?

Thanks!
