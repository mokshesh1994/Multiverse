Dad,
I hope you are okay. I miss you terribly. I hate the war, I hate it. Theres no reason for a lawyer to get drafted, none at all. Its just the (un)luck of the draw, I guess, but that doesnt get me my dad back.
Living with Tom and Barbara is awful. They dont treat me like a person, they lock me in my room, they dont let me do anything. Im writing to you because it is all I have - they left me my typewriter. Its hard to believe, Dad, that Tom is your brother. The two of you are nothing alike! Youre kind and generous, and hes Anyway, Ill see you again soon, I hope.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

Dad,
It is so frustrating living with these people. Im seventeen - youd think they would see that Im almost a woman! But rather, it has been days since I have left this room, with the exception of school. Its like a prison, almost. Sometimes he comes in and asks me if I know why he has done this. I tell him no. He says it is because I am worthless and do not deserve friends. Please come home safe - this man scares me.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

Dad,
How is the war treating you? Are you alright? I havent gotten an official telegram yet, at least to my knowledge, so Ill assume you are okay. I know its only been a week, but it seems like much longer. Tom is no longer locking me in my room, but I have locked myself in, because I am frightened of what he will do if I leave. I hear him bickering loudly with Barbara about why they took me in in the first place. Neither seems to be happy with the decision. Oh, how I wish they would love me!
Sincerely yours,
Anna

Dad,
This is going to be a long one, for I have no explanation shorter for the events that took place last night. Tom came into my room again, and he asked me why I was even alive. That took me by surprise, so I told him that when a man loves a woman He didnt like that answer, it seems. He slapped me across the face, then he hit me over the head with his wine bottle. Thankfully, it was empty. Imagine the mess! But it still hurt, and I havent been seeing straight since.
Then he asked me if Id ever had sex before. I didnt know what the correct answer was, as this was an odd question, so I told him the truth - no, I hadnt. I dont think he cared what my answer was, because he started to undress me. I told him I didnt like it, that he was my uncle, that it was not okay, but he proceeded to do the unthinkable. He took my flower without my permission. I feel utterly violated and I do not wish to live here any longer.
This is a terrible place, Dad. I want to come home now, before Tom does anything worse. What I dont understand, really, is how Barbara can be married to a man like that. He must treat her the same way - in fact, I know he does. He screams at her, he slaps her, and I cant imagine theres any romance in their love life. Its quite concerning, honestly.

Dad,
You dont believe me? Why would I make up a story like that and tell only you? For attention? For pity? No, I was being truthful one hundred percent. Your brother is not the angel you may have thought.
It has happened again, twice. I am frightened by the sight of him, the thought of him, the sound of him. It is concerning to live here, it is driving me insane.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

August 17, 1942
Dad,
Your brother is a horrible, no-good man. I try to forgive him, for Christ asks us to do so, but how can a man like that be forgiven? I cannot, I will not. It is too much to ask of me.
I still am having problems in my head from when he beat me with that wine bottle. It shattered and I got glass all over my bed and in my skin, but the worst is the throbbing pain just in that corner of my head. I asked to go to the hospital. They asked why, and I said for this bump on my head. And where did it come from, asked Tom? From you- I start, but he says no, not from me, you fell, understand? And we are not going to no hospital. You are a weak little duckling, he says, you dont deserve to be alive today. I think that means he wants to kill me, Dad, what can I do?
Yours,
Anna

August 21, 1942
Dad,
It has been one long month since I moved in here, and that was one month too many. I need to get out of here. I am packing a bag and leaving tonight. Where Ill go, Im not sure. Perhaps a bomb shelter. Its bound to be safer than here.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

August 22, 1942
Dad,
They caught me leaving. I got the worst beating yet. I can barely type, my arms are so sore. He used cigarette butts this time, burning my arms and legs. In addition, the house reeks of smoke and burnt flesh. I miss you dearly, I want to leave here, I want to go home! Is home nearby? I could drive there!
Sincerely yours,
Anna

August 29, 1942
Dad,
I am losing hope in this world. I dont think I can make it much longer. Like Tom says, I wasnt meant to be alive anyway. I was probably some accident, right? I hold some hope for the day you return.
Its only getting worse here. He is having sex with me every day now. I cannot stop him, or else I would. If I tell someone at school, they call me a hussy or a bimbo. I told the cops, they dont believe me. Its his word against yours, they say. So if its my word against his, why do they take his without even a trial?
Sincerely yours,
Anna

Dad,
Barbara is starting to come to my defense. Of course, this only gets her beaten, but at least she sees that something is wrong. It is a gift of God that we have this child, she says, maybe you should treat it with a little respect. She says this in the hall so I cant hear, but I can, of course. He says, Barbara, this is the worst-behaved child I have ever met. She doesnt obey me, she lays around all day, she doesnt do her homework - when Barbara interrupts and says Tom, thats because you frighten her. Tom says, So? A parent is supposed to frighten their child. That is how you establish power. Barbara says no, you are supposed to love a child. I dont know whos right theoretically, but I know that Toms parenting style is the worst Ive ever seen.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

Dad,
Barbara is a wonderful woman when you get to know her. Its just that husband of hers whos awful. I tell her, leave that man, you dont need that man. She says no, she cant, she promised him and God shed stay. But hes endangering us, I said. Barbara wouldnt have it. She was so devoted that she couldnt put herself (and me) before a promise.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

September 6, 1942
Dad,
Tom is beating me every day. I dont know what I did, but its getting to be too much. I have started thinking about ending my life because of him. It is really a problem. And dont you say, Dad, that its all for attention. If you lived like this, youd want to die too. I think its worse than war, I really do.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

September 9, 1942
Dad,
I have a plan. Im going to London bridge at midnight and jumping. But not tonight. I have to wait and see if things get better. I will ask him to apologize. If he does, I will not jump. If he does not Well, well see.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

September 11, 1942
Dad,
He didnt apologize. This is my goodbye letter to you. Never put your life so fully in someone elses hands that you no longer have control over your own life and death. It is my downfall, dont let it be yours. I apologize to you, because you will never get to see your beloved daughter again. And I accept your apology in advance, and all your regrets, for leaving me here. But thats okay. Tom showed me the truth about myself. I am not worth the dust you walk on, Dad. It is unfortunate, yes, but it is true. I am obnoxious, I am an accident, I was never meant to be. There are so many things wrong with me, Dad, I dont know how I made it this far.
I will tell Mum that you love her. Hopefully we will not meet again for many years. Do not do what I am doing, it is a mistake, but it is a mistake I must make.
Sincerely yours,
Anna

September 13, 1942
Dad,
This is me writing from the hospital. I have a broken neck and collarbone, as well as two broken arms and a sprained ankle. Jumping from a bridge is not the kind of activity you want to survive. Theyll be sending me to an institution as soon as Im well. Hopefully there I can be happy. I want to tell you, I love you. And Tom, despite everything.
Yours,
Anna
