I race down the misty valleys with my brothers at my side. We flow as one as we reflect the spring sunshine accordingly. Taking each turn as graceful as the last sometimes jumping off the rocks to impress each other. The next leg of the race awaits us as we get closer and day gets darker.

Creating waves is a must to overcome the rocky formations that lay before us in section two. Small drops lead us to bounce and fall back into place. The more we work together the faster this area is over and we can get to the final stretch. 

All of us prepare ourselves as we calmly head towards the red horizon. Night is almost upon us as we start heading towards "the big fall". We all shine red momentarily and back to blue as we watch the ones after us repeat. We don't want to go too fast that we don't fall together.

We brace ourselves for the last part. The climax of the event, the reason we are here. We fall as one almost clinging onto one another to no avail. Some people get lost in the crowd at the bottom while others join the small group and leave their other one behind. The cheers at the bottom is to be said that humans can hear it which I find hard to believe but I guess not impossible. I too join the bottom and let out a gratifying cheer and swiftly move into the endless crowd. So big you can only see them and sky for miles.

As the sun dies and the stars come out I know it will be another long time until something like that happens again. Some say you never do the same course twice, perhaps similar, but never the same.
