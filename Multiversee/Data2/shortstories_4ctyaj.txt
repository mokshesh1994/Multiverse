'what's she looking at?' i was wondering as I glanced at her from a far. She was unlike any girl I have seen before. Describing her as beautiful would almost sound insulting if you ask me. She was the kind of girl you'd think about again and again after just one sight. 
Majestic.

 The rush of emotions I felt when I heard her speak was unparalleled. I could compare her actions to the crashing of waves on a shore somewhere far away. Maybe it was love. Maybe it was love meant to be for another dimension, another universe. The thought of her and I would only be possible in my imagination or dreams. How could I possibly be so in love with a girl I have never even spent 'enough' time with? I just knew it. I felt it. 

She makes me so irrational. Realizing that I'd live a life without her felt so depressing yet inspiring. I feel like our paths would only cross that one time and never again meet. this is the universe where her and I never get to love each other. I could say I'd love her 'till my death on this planet after just one moment with her. We never even touched. 

I wonder if I had any effect on her at all. Without her I would feel more like a mess than I did before, but at the same time hopeful. That ending my life wouldn't do anyone justice. I could dream of endless possible realities with her and only end up fulfilling one. The one I am experiencing right now. 

The happiness of meeting her and the sadness of not being with her. It hurts and at the same time gives me a sense of inner peace. She. The reason why I'm here on this planet. To see her and feel this way has changed my life forever. I feel like my life would have gone differently if I had not seen her that day. She's helping me complete my personal legend. Without her even being around. All I needed was to know she existed. The perfect girl.
