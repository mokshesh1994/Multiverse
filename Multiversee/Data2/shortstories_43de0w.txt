100 word story 

Where to go? I searched the internet. Found the perfect place. They even had their own famous dolphin. Showed the site to my husband.
"Are you sure?" he said. "We may not get to see him."
"I'm sure," I replied.
So on my birthday we traveled down to my chosen place. The scenery was magnificent. I was in love with the place. Our hotel was perfect. I had such a relaxing time.
This year it will be our fourth time going. I have yet to the see the Dolphin. Maybe, just maybe this time I will.
