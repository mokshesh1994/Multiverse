The piercing screams of dying men were drowning out my own gasp for the life saving breath I needed. My brothers were around me, kneeling to their cause, holding onto a new scarlet limb sprouting from their chest with a steel tipped finish. I had a storm before my eyes; a cloud of regret, it masked what I could see, but I felt the dampened moss within the fingernails and the chipped bark upon the tree that I lean. They came from the shadows of the wood, like an owl on its prey, or in other words, just like an ambush on mere men. My eyes may not serve me as they once did, but my ears are as tipped as a fox, or so I thought. I have a deep pit in my stomach where my mistakes of this moment are being brewed to burden me again one day. I could not move. I was pinned to this great oak by a new limb of my own; held in place while I listen to my brothers in arms scream their last calls. Some of them gave a whisper of a loved one, but most I heard pleaded with mercy and that gave me deep sorrow to those who stayed humble in death. It felt strangely satisfying when they had their throats lacerated because I no longer had to feel the overwhelming shiv of betrayal. In my own experience, not many arrows that I have seen loosened can pass through the whole of a mans body and hold you in place where you wait to be dealt with; let alone a man bearing armor. However, this arrow that held me to the tree was loosed by a brother; or should I say an old friend that I once betrayed. A lone wolf amongst men. A man under the hood.
