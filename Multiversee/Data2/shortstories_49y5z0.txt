# -- You don't exist

By now it will all be gone. Whenever there was something, it is now a sea of dust or molecules drifting in the endless void of space. You are not reading this, you don't exist, this journal does not exist. You may ask why I am writing this if I am so sure. I would say therapy, possibly finding some meaning in this mess. But then again, I am being naive, there is no meaning, there never has been. I might write this because I am human, as we appear to have a basic urge to understand and pass on, to put 1 and 1 together. But only to a certain point, so our little brains can comprehend, are not over-strained. You may argue that this is untrue and that scientists and philosophers try to push the envelope, think the unthinkable, every day. But then again, what is the use of an ant knowing how to cook lasagna if it can be squashed by the giant boot of Dany Doyle, that notoriously happy kid from next door.
But I am getting ahead of myself -  not that it matters. So for whatever reason I will try to put down the series of events that leads to, well, nothingness.

It all began with something rather unspectacular. There was a news story about a school class that found some kind of meteoroid fragment, about 90cm in diameter, somewhere on a beach in Cambodia. One of the largest ever found. The scientists lot went all crazy about it and tested and probed - extremely happy of heaving found rare minerals and new insight into the history of our solar system. The official theory was that strong currents, due to a Tsunami that flattened parts of the costal area the previous year, must have transported the 'object' to relatively shallow waters. After a few days, the story dropped out of the news cycle and was replaced by more war in the middle east, a presidential election in France and the new craze of the year: spoke-less bicycle wheels. We could have tried harder to make our existence significant but in the end, we might as well have enjoyed the ride. We did neither. 

I took the geniuses from NASA 4 months to figure out that something was off with this little meteoroid fragment. That in fact, this little rock represented something that they were not able to comprehend  even if they tried. Before they declared a complete communication lock-down there was a science nerd called Dr. Robert Finchley, or Finechley Roberts?, a post-doc at one of these elite laboratories full of bright minds and large egos. He appeared as an 'expert'  on one of these 1 Minute 'news' segments late at night, when the TV stations run out of meaningless crap to broadcast. Finchley talked mostly about general stuff, that our planet was formed by asteroids bla bla, that we can still see the craters everywhere, and so forth. However, he then continued, mostly unnoticed by the degenerated TV crowd, to say one sentence that stuck out. He said: There are still a few interesting open questions regarding the surface structure, as it does not show the usual signs of entry. 

As most TV  viewers, took off their shoes, put on their pyjamas and went to bed, dreaming, if they did at all, about important things such as beaches, careers or the sex they would never have, two people wrote in the segment's on-line comment section. One was a veteran venting about tax money being spend on rocks rather than on medical care. The other person, with the pseudonym 'CactusMike42', kindly asked if Finchley would post some close-up pictures of the meteoroid fragment and one from an meteoroid that shows the usual signs of entry. 'CactusMike42' never got a reply, but his comment must have triggered a series of events that made a few dormant senior scientist, lethargically drifting in the steep hierarchy of the nationals space agency, have a closer look at the meteoroid fragment. It must have dawned on them that what they were seeing could not be true. Could not be though out. That this little meteoroid should be happily zooming through space and not lie motionless in their lab. That there is no way this rock could have made it here and look box-fresh. That every possible explanation is implausible. That this is different. 

NASA never gave out an official statement regarding these inconsistencies. Ironically, decades of denying the existence of UFOs and aliens prepared them perfectly for denying something that was actually real. They went so far to declare that the meteoroid fragment was lost in transit to a Nevada storage facility. They even fired a few people to make it look plausible. After this, nothing happened. Life went on. Like dropping a tray in the cafeteria. Everybody looks, smiles and moves on. Nothing happened. 

It was 6 years before the next incident, or 'glitch' how we like to call them now, accrued. And this time, it was less obvious, less in your face, than before. The glitch was conveniently covered up by thousands of physical and meteorological parameters and a horde of career junkie scientist that used  every means possible to interpret the incident in a way that supports their individual research career rather than trying to figure out what the hell was going on. To cut it short, some fancy satellite system, that was designed to measure the earth's surface structure, registered that the sea-level in the pacific was 9cm lower than usual at that time of the year. As the 'experts' on TV pointed out, varying sea level is nothing too unexpected. Meteorological models where built, sea currents where calculated, measurement buoys where deployed, aircraft with highly sensitive measurement equipment where sent, lasers where pointed and after 2 years, the international research community concluded that they had found an explanation for the phenomenon, detailed in 427 pages of finely crafted English, formulas and plots. They were wrong. 

They set out to find Waldo. They found Waldo. Problem is, there was no Waldo, Waldo was gone.

For this journal to make any sense I ought to write down who I am, to give some perspective, a point of reference, even if this undertaking appears laughable if there is nothing left to point to. My name is Daniel or Dan, I am 32 years old  from Colorado. My life was like your life, it was average. I was ok at most things. My days were ok, I like to think I was happy. It was not special in any kind of way. Anyone could have written this journal, many probably did.

Before the glitches started to become more severe, I worked at the local milk factory. I remember being amazed by the endless, hypnotic rows of identical milk bottles moving through the plant, the countless overhead spot-lights reflecting in the shiny bottle-necks, giving rise to infinitely repeating sequence of oddly distorted shapes and patterns. Like a perfectly orchestrated dance of black and white, set to go on forever. 
Back then, there was no doubt that the next day, there would be a sufficient number of cows producing a sufficient amount of milk to be filled into another endless line of shiny milk bottles who would agree to flow through the plant in an identical fashion to their countless predecessors.  

I learned that this illusion of certainty, the illusion of stability, the illusion of repeatability, the illusion of an unquestionable order is, well, an illusion. 
These milk bottles merely agree to be part of this illusion as long as there is nothing to upset them, no glitch, that would bring instant chaos to their perfect world of linear happiness. 

Back then I would not think about these things, back then I was like you.                 

The day I met Ruth was a Thursday. It was one of these mild summer evening, where you can smell the moisture evaporating from the grass sprinkled by a passing thunderstorm. Insects buzzing through the air, still struggling to gain altitude from the extra load of tiny water droplets attached to their bodies. I remember those things so clearly since they are the only memories that matter to me now, everything else has proven to be meaningless. 

I felt sick. I just worked a 12 hour shift and had struck a fever in the morning. The sea of green grass, the orange sky, the moist air blurred into mass of paint so thick it felt hard to breathe. Power line poles, so perfectly spaced for optimal support, created a rhythmic noise with my speeding car. I struggled to keep awake. Then, everything turned black.

When I woke up, I found myself in a strange bed in a strange house. It was dark outside and I could see the stars shining through a window above. I never really understood why we are so obsessed by these tiny dots in the sky, but that night their mere presence was calming. Next to me was Ruth, sleeping and breathing deeply. I cannot explain why, but that night I felt complete, for the first and only time in my life, even though I slept next to a complete stranger and I could feel the pain of cuts and burns all over my body. At dawn, Ruth brought me some tea and changed my bandages. She told me to call a doctor. I never did. This is all I want so say about Ruth. Who she was and what she meant to me I am unable to bring to paper. She is the one that gave my life meaning. 

Our daughter Anabel was born shortly after we moved to small farm house 10miles away from the milk factory. Anabel was a demanding but very happy kid, scribbling colourful little dots and lines  she called them stick-fairies  all over the barn. Ruth looked after Anabel and the handful of animals that we we were able to afford. I continued to work at the milk factory. These were the happiest days of my life.

The simplicity of my existence may appear limited to you. I agree. But simplicity has a virtue, it is less likely to fail. Simple things will continue to exist if great change is upon us. Complex things will perish.
