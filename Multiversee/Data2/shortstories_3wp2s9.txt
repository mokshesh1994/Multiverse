-Youre a parochial pusilsanimous parasite, worthy of little beyond its next breath.


Conniving knife whispers threats pulling hirsute buffoon from the street by its yeard.


First Met in an alley off Fiztroy blood shot eye flapping gently on its cheek snik snik and the prize is caught, but not cast


-you want I should tell now boss
-naw Harvey, we need a good stirring first says flatcapfishman


hirsute buffoon is moaning but kens it can be worse. Maybe a noose, maybe a loosening of the bowels. These were the First Mets. Meterological Seers sliced septums and blue woad arses. Barbie queuing for the long drop just for the patterned fecal spray. Eyes in a chancers game of bitch and toss, 10 insouciant pretty boys lazy dry rutting on the old gropers filth, garroting till blue. Entrail mix scattered over teacups or a quick call to the horoshows when stuck. Lonely walks on petrov hill, looking for the gun man. You'll do what you're told, we just need to see which tree you to weep against as he levels his rifle. Your yearn for life of no interest to the mets, not when they can know. no magic more greedy than forecasting. Do as your told and find your tree, don't you love me?


All for me. I need seered, going forward. Need to know the next step, would hate to slip


A commotion from the street.....the walkie-talkies on 1st and 3rd take the fifth when asked and when pushed the say Nein we aint seen nothing or I heard about a guy down cliftonville, heard he paid the Mets for a time, but got nothing but a spayed wife and a spatchcock daughter. Yeah boss, heard it truesay, heard it loud and low. Dont trust the Mets man.


Yeah, yeah say truthers and slide on past Fitzroy, happy to be misdirected


The mets push Barbie and read the miasma of rubin kicked out hard. I give the nod to the gunman and lady is popped by the willow tree. guess she did love me.


-its not enough Harve, cast the eye and Harvey casts the eye into the spit and semen bullseye dripped out on the floor, only 2 insouciant rutters left, the boy with mum and dad tattooed arm submits at last and quivers dead erect. the eye lands lens up on the 20 line. Harvey giggles, then turns fast, gutting knife to my perineum, but Im an old hand, my thumb knife blinds him fast and my leather taint has seen it all before.


fucking mets always want more.


-Whats the answer Fishman I shout, holding Harvey at harms length.


-31st and 47th Tuesday next.


Harvey drops and I slide backwards, close to whimpering buffoon, a quick flicksnik slide twist and eviscerate


The guts on the ground


-for you fishman, tell you who leaves the alley alive


Im done and gone


the ancient projectionist smiles a grimace and starts into the film reel scissors and paper glue in hand
-gotta keep him guessing he shouts in a new yoik drawl
cigar puffing bright and he hacks a new version of the old flick. barbie's drop not worth a shit afterall



still, it was a laugh
