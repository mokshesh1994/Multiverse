I had barely a chance to enter my chamber before my peace was befouled by his presence.

 He stood before me, silent, eyeing my person as a stray, starved to a quiet, brooding lust for my essence. 

I was piturbed, to say the least. For what reason does this creature have to disrupt my own solitude for its own selfish desire of my soul.

" Be mindful demon", I said to him. " Be not so careless in encroahing my 
dwellings". 
Addressing him directly brought forth no response.

 I was dreadfully unaroused by his intrusion as wished only for a restful bout of sleep.

I abruptly stepped around him, undoing my trousers and removing my shoes in process.

Still as a breathless sigh, he turned himself about to maintain a strong gaze
enamoured with the prospect of my soul. 

I unfastoned my tie and removed my shirt, donned my evening blouse and, once more, faced this rude abomination seeking to unnerve my character.

" You can stand there if you like", the annoyance in my voice was was masked with an apathetic tone.

" Be forewarned, though. Any attempt to molest my wellbeing, be it through an attempt to possess or infiltrate my dreams, will be taken as an affront to my patience and courtesy.
 I will not stand for it in the least and you will suffer the consequence if you do". 

A light faded from his eyes and no longer seemed envisioned with the prospect of comsuming my breath. He slacked his form and began to fade away.

I granted him one last nod in his departure," I bid you goodnight , sir", and snuffed my lamp.
