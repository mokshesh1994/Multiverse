First post and any feedback would be delish



If fish were way bigger and could live on land I probably wouldnt regularly say things like Wow, fuck fish and  I dont think fish should have the right to vote because I would genuinely fear for my safety.

After a couple of drinks I would no longer say thing like  I could beat any salmon in hand to hand combat or Asian Carp drive poorly because I would fear an attack by an interracial Salmon-Carp couple.
 
I would probably stop saying things like something smells fishy about this or Ive got bigger fish to fry just in case a group of drunk sardines overheard me in a club and decided to beat the shit out of me.

I would stop saying jokes like  Why dont fish like basketball? Because theyre afraid of the net or what did the fish say when he posted bail? Im off the hook because of the possibility that these insensitive jokes could incur the wrath of the giant fish-community. And Id just like to point out that when I say giant fish-community I am speaking metaphorically but also incredibly literally. These are humongous fish.
 
I would also stop saying things like There are plenty of fish in the sea or I feel like a fish out of water but not out of my fear for fish-wrath but simply because theyd no longer make sense. 

Despite all of this, to the best of my knowledge, fish are still confined to water where they belong and hopefully where they will forever remain.
