The sunlit grass in the forest illuminated the trees above, bringing a certain ethereal quality to the beauty of nature in front of me. I do not know why I am here, only that I have been here all my life. I have not left this forest, and do not know much of the world outside. Information of other worlds come to me through my friends, who tell me what it is like on the other side, but I cannot relate, only marvel at kindred versions of me, in other worlds anew.

I have always considered myself to be altruistic, I worry too much about what others think and place them before myself. In the other worlds, I can try to fit in, but I always come back to this forest, where I am sometimes happy, this forest of imagination. In this world, I can create a world for myself, rather than try to fit in another, which is something I am not good at; fitting in.
I constantly try to reach out to the other side, only I know that my arms do not reach far enough, and I will always release my grip, and relax again in this forest of hopes and dreams. Hopefully, someday, I will reach out and breathe the air of another world, but for now, I can only dream more and more, until eventually I should stop dreaming.
