Either late in the night or early in the morning, something woke my wife and I up.  She pretended it didn't but I knew she was awake.  I could hear her breathing carefully.  I sat up and listened closer.  It sounded like a woman calling for help.  I sat there for another minute or so and considered just lying back and going to bed.  Despite this conflict, I stood up and reached for the bat.  My wife called to me from the deep blue comforter "please, don't go down there".  I just looked at her with what I assume was an expression combining longing with fright.  I kept walking towards the door, I was no longer hearing her calls, only kicking, struggling and the voices of men telling her things like "just relax, just relax it'll all be over soon".  I kept walking, one eye on the door, one on my wife.  I stopped about halfway between the door and our bed.  I could hear my heart beating while I heard them beating her.  I looked back at my wife, and just stood there with a suddenly crippling sense of self-doubt.  Something kept kicking off and on in me, I don't understand why this is bothering me so much more than the other beatings in the alley behind the house.  And that's when I realized, our daughter hadn't been home.

This is based on a really short description someone gave me of a short story my cousin wrote and got commended for.  Obviously added to it, but he came up with the central idea (wife is conflict to stay, cries are conflict to leave).
