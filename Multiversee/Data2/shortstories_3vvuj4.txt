Business as Usual

&nbsp;


Stepping off the plane after the grueling fifteen hour flight, I quickly make my way to nearest open bar stool to grab a little something to numb away the panging migraines. Ever since I was a little kid I had flying sickness. Great to know that my body has adapted so well even after all these years and the countless flights. This was my first time flying to Singapore so I guess that was a plus. The plush cushioned seat was a bit of a downgrade from the business class seats the flight had to offer but it was magnitudes better to finally be stationary. I signal the bartender over and order a gin and tonic. He noticed how distress I was but that was no surprise to him. Im sure hes had his fair share of ill patrons visit his shop. 

&nbsp;

Rough trip?

&nbsp;

Always, I sigh as I slump down onto the bar shelf. He tops off the drink with a lime and slides it my way. Crisp delight. Its the simple pleasures that really put me at ease. I sip on my mix as I listen to the somber jazz playing in the background. Alright, time to go. I sling my briefcase to the side and make my way to the Crowne Plaza.

&nbsp;

Another benefit of working for the company I work for is they know how to appease their employees. Soft leather couches and abstract colorful paintings adorned the lobby. A robust chandelier hung heavy from the ceiling. The floors, spotless. Not a blemish in sight. As busy as the airport is known for, the lack of guests trafficking the lobby even at the wee hours was a refreshing detail. Nothing less than the 5-stars it deserved. For lack of better words, this place was grand.
I approach the concierge to check-in. He clicks away at the computer and Im soon off to my room for some well-deserved R&R. The single king sized room was no less grand than the lobby. I paid little attention to the rest of the room as I collapse into the satin sheets. I grin as I pick up the slight scent of lavender emanating from the feather pillow. Off to dream world I went. 

&nbsp;

My peace was short enjoyed as I was awoken by a sudden chill. Even under all the blankets it was strangely cold. An annoyed grimace stretched across my face as I was forced to get up to adjust the thermostat. click click click I pressed on the meter yet none of the numbers changed. Great
I call up the front desk to address the issue only to be informed that all the maintenance staff had left for the evening. Great The concierge said he would send a representative to bring up additional sheets. Better than nothing I suppose.

&nbsp;

It wasnt too long before I hear a knock on the door. Wrapped in some sheets, I make my way to answer the door. The gate swings open and I am greeted by a female staff member holding an armful of sheets. 

&nbsp;

We apologize for the discomfort. Is there anything else I can-, she abruptly stops, Nathan? 

&nbsp;

Too focused on accepting the sheets I failed to look at the face of my attendant. My eyes shift with surprise at the mention of my name. My attendant was quite the beauty. A round face adorned with soft autumn colored hair that hung below her shoulders, eyes, a dark blend of coffee that offered a warming glint, and a familiar smile that glowed with honest delight. I was flooded with memories of days long pasted during my years at university. Of the long walks along the pond by the inner-city park. Of the sleepless nights of endless conversation over the phone. Of the countless hours spent hopping from venue to venue. Of the time we snuck into the botanical gardens to skip out on paying for the entrance fee to the festival of lights. Of the warm tender hands on those cold winter nights. Of the kisses we shared. Of the sorrowful farewell. Nostalgic bubbles popping in my chest. The sheets slip out of my hands as my mind was boggled by the resurgence of memories. Sophie? 

&nbsp;

What are you doing here?

&nbsp;

Uh-, I stammer, Just business, I laugh sheepishly, What about you? I thought you were still in Hong Kong.

&nbsp;

I ended up being stationed here. Not my first choice but I really like it here. Never mind about that. This is crazy. How have you been?

&nbsp;

Yeah this is really something. Ive been good. Really good. Oh, I quickly pick up my dropped sheets. Just you knowbusiness as usual. I desperately fight the grin growing on my face. Umthanks for the sheets.

&nbsp;

Stop being so formal. Its weird.

&nbsp;

Haha, sorry. The awkward air was palpable as a long pause followed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Well it was nice seeing you again. She begins to walk away. Come on man, I think to myself. Dont let her walk away. Not again.

&nbsp;

Hey Sophie, wait! She stops and turns to look back at me over her shoulder. My mind races as I try to think up something to say. The rooms you guys have are really nice, but theres another problem with my room. I was wondering if you could check it out for me. She turns around and walks back in my direction. I lead her inside and head towards the bed. This bed is uh, too soft. Just feel it. She plops down on the bed. See what I mean? She smiles at me gingerly, signaling for me to accompany her. I sit down too and we begin to reminisce about the past, talking about the time we spent together and then about our roads to where we are today. I lose track of time and soon an hour has past.
I think I should get going now. George will probably be worried that I havent returned yet. She gets up to leave but I am quick to take her hand.

&nbsp;

You know, these king-sized beds are pretty big. They get lonely sometimes. She giggles at my desperate attempt. She smiles.

&nbsp;

I cant. Her fingers slip through my grip. There she goes again. She makes her way to the door. My coffee-eyed serendipity. No. I rise up, rush to her and embrace her deeply. 

&nbsp;

Time, doesnt heal wounds. It only replaces memories. But my memories of you can never be replaced. I miss you Sophie. This is too bittersweet. I cant let you go again. We stand rigid for what feels like an eternity. Her hands meet mine.

&nbsp;

Ive missed you too. She turns around and clasps me just as passionately. Ill apologize to George in the morning.

&nbsp;

The next day was a sunny one. Another beautiful morning. Another beautiful day.
