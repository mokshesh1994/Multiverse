TIME: NO FUCKING CLUE HAHAHA

I AM FUCKING LOSING IT!......I have been stuck in this apartment for I don't know how many days, weeks I don't know It's been too long I know that, and I know I am going to have to make another run for food. I just don't want to go out there with those fucking things, those uknowns, those......demons? I don't know what the are but they scare the hell out of me. I know they can hear me think, they can get inside of my fucking mind and I can't take. I've only seen them twice since I've made my runs to gather supply or food It's either always a dark red or pitch black outside so I can never get a good look at them. From what I know they must at least be 7 to 8 feet tall I can never really tell because they're always hunched over in the hallways of the apartment when I see them. They have this pale white body sometimes with a hint of green spots and they're chest......is the worst part about these guys its just one giant RED AND YELLOW EYE PUPILATED AND BLACK as if the red and yellow didn't look sickening and tormenting enough. Their arms are lengthy with these long slender fingers and you can always tell when one is near OH GOD THAT FUCKING SCREECHING  when they drag their nails across the floors and walls. Want to know what's worse this isn't always the case sometimes you DONT HEAR SHIT AND THEY JUST SNEAK UP THOSE FUCKING BITCHES!!!!! COME FUCKING GET ME. Anyways after I lost my first Journal I'm writing another one someone has to keep track of all this RIGHT?!  My name is Alexander and this is my journey living in damnation on earth.
