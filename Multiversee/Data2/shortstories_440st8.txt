We are together. Are are committed. We are partners. We are lovers. But I wish you were in love with me. I wish you made the choice every day, to pick me, the day I pick you. I wish I was as important as your paycheck, your long-distance friend, your potential interview. I wish when I cried, you felt sad, instead of angry and frustrated. I wish you knew that all those times I said "okay" that it wasn't, but I made it so. I wish you would look at my messages on your phone and respond when you saw them, instead of later when you "had time." I wish you woke up early one Saturday to surprise me with coffee instead of sleeping past noon. I wish you weren't the nicest to me in front of your friends, but alone, in the intimacy of our own space. I wish you would give me the key to your house, instead of an excuse about needing space. I wish you sent me flowers to my office. I wish I knew where you were all those times that I didn't. I wish you were in love with me, or that I was less in love with you.
