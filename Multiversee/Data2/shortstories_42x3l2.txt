If this gets a good response I would be happy to post the finished product in a couple of weeks time.

No-one...

The Bankstown train trundled along. On this day, Friday the 3rd of February, carriage four was the home of every known life form. Seated in the four seater at the back corner were the schools gang of Lebanese year 12 students. Oi pussybitch! Alex knew who Dhakir was talking to as soon as the words left his mouth. He sighed as he glanced up from his iPod. One look of his defeated face was all it took to send the boys from the burbs into raptures of laughter. Mothers, uncomfortable at the sight of so much testosterone and so little intelligence, took a sudden interest in how well their shoes were tied. Business men, much too important to be involving themselves in such a petty incident, buried their heads in their phones like emus. Bystanding students, used to this daily occurrence, hardly flinched. It was well known that the boys from the burbs used all twelve of their combined brain cells to come up with that pathetic excuse for an insult. Its just what they did. Thats the way it is, always has been, and always will be. At least until the end of the year. Sinking back into his seat, Alex music narrated the movie only he could see by looking out the window of the Bankstown train.
