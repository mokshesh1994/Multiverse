Hey, So I am not a writer, more of a story teller really, I tend to write in stream of conscious or as a narrative. Then I refine a bit. I wrote this short chapter today to kick off an ongoing story I want to tell. Take a look C&C, and feed back welcomed. The story is being hosted on my personal blog that I am getting back to after a long Hiatus/neglect.  But here it is.
