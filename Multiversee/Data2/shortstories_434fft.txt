This is a xpost from /r/WritingPrompts that I wanted to get feedback on. The prompt was It was a moonless night, the air was still and the crickets were silent


It was a moonless night, the air was still and the crickets were silent The temperature was brisk while I waited for my target to go on his usual smoke break. It was almost like clockwork. Every night he goes into the woods at 2200 to sit on his favorite stump and have a smoke before he makes his rounds through the stables. I could not screw up this assassination; the entire war depended on it. 

The man I was contracted to kill was General Stones slave Anumi. Contrary to what the masses believed, General Stone was not the all-knowing tactician that he portrayed himself as. Anumi was actually the mastermind behind all of the maneuvers and placement of troops. The rebels would not be where they were without him. That is why he must die.

The rustle of fabric moving across leaves signified his leaving of the tent. Yes sir, I will make sure your horse has a full barrel of apples in its stall. Anumi said. You could almost hear the sarcasm layered beneath his respectful tone. Anumi wasnt much to look at. He was average height, brown wiry hair, and not a single sign of muscle on him at all. Those eyes though, they were a bright piercing blue; they seemed to stare right into a persons soul.

As Anumi started to walk towards the forest, he gave a quick glance around to make sure no one was watching him. As always, not a single soldier was walking at this side of camp, it was one of the reasons that Anumi chose this time to go smoke. Slaves were not permitted to indulge in tobacco or alcohol, secrecy was key.

Anumi walked over to the hollowed out stump containing his tobacco, constantly looking around to make sure no one was around. Little did he know, I have been waiting in this tree all night for this exact moment. He would never see my blade comingHe would die tonight
