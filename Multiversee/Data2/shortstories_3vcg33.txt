How hard can it be to close a door. Say I told you that if you shut this metaphorical door now you would lose everything you have. You would lose memories of your family, friends, first love but you would still be you. Say you would still look like you but your mentality may change, a new beginning if you will. What if i told you two new doors open. 

The first door has everything anyone could ever want. Except the things I previously told you you would lose. No worry, no stress and all the time you ever needed to accomplish whatever you desire. Would you take that door? Would you sacrifice or kill for that door?

Door 2 however has everything you fear. Loneliness, darkness, sickness and constant worry. No friends or anyone who would want to talk to you. Emptiness. Would you kill for that door? Would you take all precautions to avoid that door?

What if I told you that you couldn't decide which door would open. And you may not have to open any at all. But you still would have to close the other door eventually. What if I told you there is a third door. A door that exists only through your conscience thoughts now. But if you do go in that door you would never know.

What if you have no choice to shut the door. You have some control when it shuts but no choice on the doors open.

Now, what if I say don't worry. Everybody has to do this.
