Headboards head to head, the two brothers layed, talking into sleep. Drifting off in the dark room he hears-want to play twenty questions? Sure he said...it was late and he was tired. But why not...
I'm thinking of a person.
Is it someone famous?
No
Is it a relative?
No
Is it someone we know?
No but he knows you
Sports star?
Ha...No
Is it someone real?
Yes. Quite.
Is it someone I'd like?
No
~who could this be? Why wouldn't I like them? He thought...
Is it someone bad?
Yes
~the tone this time was different. The voice sounded....off...
Snoring...who's snoring? A quick peek over the headboard-his brother fast asleep. Frozen. Staring at his sleeping face. A chill colder than a frozen day. Terror.
Don't you want to know why I'm bad? The voice speaking into his ear now. Breath like the air from hot coals.
Wimpering, watching tears fall on his brothers face. 
His brother never knew, never felt a thing.
