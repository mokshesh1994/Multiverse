A long time ago, there was a group of friends who lived in a moving library. They roamed the world, always learning from the great libraries, connected to the world brain.

Today was no different. Outside of Nosscire, they waited for dusk. When the sun would set, they would be ready to enter this great library. It was their first time here. Things felt different. Usually the would walk right in, connect to the books one on one. 

Not here at Nosscire. A famously cautious town -- high-walls, here since the last war, never came down in the years of peace. They came up with a different approach. Surely, no one could be denied access to a great library. But they need not enter the city. 

At 100m, you started to feel it -- a wizard's new power connecting to you. The friends all looked at each other. 

"I heard his powers truly work", said one, transfixed on the city.

"You think we can reliably get all the knowledge from the library without being there, without being connected? You're a fool", sneered another.

A hawk buzzed over head. The fortress of the great SIG stood nearby. They set the rules, and the comrades wondered if they could obey them.

The sun began to wink out of sight.

"Ready?" said a burly compatriot.

"Sure", snarled the negative personality which is in every group.

At once a glow came over the city. The elders stood up. "If the tooth is blue, from a distance we can view. By the power of Bjarkan and the runes of Futhark, we summon your power."

As the last words echoed, their randomly accessed memories began to fill with knowledge. Those that tried to speak simply gurgled with the power of the hive mind filling their soft excuses for brains.

"The tooth is blue, the transfer is to you..." cried an elder. They knew it had worked. A new magic was upon them now. Life would never be the same.
