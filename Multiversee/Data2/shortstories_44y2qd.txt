Hey, this is the first time for me trying something like this, so I am really looking forward to your comments and feedback.

The biggest trouble for me so far definitely was to get enough details and feelings in the story without breaking the word limit I gave myself, since it is supposed to be the first of many letters from Evan. So this will probably not be one of the best stories you have read so far ;D
