The world stopped before my very eyes. The most solitude feeling overwhelmed me. I fell to my knees gun in one hand and soil in the other, holding back tears. Every cop still in disbelief with the answers that stood before them.

A custom made graveyard for lack of description. The missing children found in the worst possible way. Yet something touched my shoulder, I slowly turned my head. The worst kind of spirit, a childs.

He smiled and pointed at the other children all standing by their former selves. They all danced around in silence happy and at peace. The strangeness of happiness after this was consuming me, to know that my outlook changed and that they are found peace. The criminal has been caught and the spirits revealed themselves in an uplifting, hopeful way. Nobody spoke a word. There was nothing to say. Regret? Somewhat. Questions? Answered.

I feel like I have lived in that moment for the rest of my life. Infact, though the truth be grim, the outcome made me realise that everyone has peace at the end.
