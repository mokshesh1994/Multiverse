One 6 and two 0's were blinking on my alarm clock. I'm late. No, it's my day off. Why did I wake up then? After few moments I heard the reason. Someone was bashing my flat door. 

"Hey, I have a parcel for Anabel Solomin," the delivery guy murmured. He had the letters "UPS" embroidered on his jacket.

He left abruptly, and I was standing alone in front of my door with a big box in my hands. Usually I love deliveries, but the problem was that I didn't order anything. 

Suddenly a small note on the side of the box caught my attention. 

From the moment you open this box, you will have  6 months left to live. The contents of the box makes it totally worth it.

Is someone pranking me? This must be Amy, that little shit. I smiled to myself.
Early morning raised my possibilities to identify myself as a psychological thriller character so I hesitated to open the package.  A slight baseless anxiousness tickled me. What if it's real? Would I sacrifice all my life for having something for 6 months? On other hand It can be some virus that kills you after six months and you don't get anything at all. I'm not opening this box. No way. I'm not stupid.

After a minute I was tearing apart that cardboard box. I'm curious, okay? No need to judge.

There was a creepily smiling minion toy and a bomb with the timer wired on the top. A tiny note said: Don't trust strangers

Beep.

The timer hit zero.
