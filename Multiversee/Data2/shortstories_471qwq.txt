I decide to go to a place where Ive never been. Im with people I barely know with only a few stories to share. I pretend to enjoy as much as everyone is to try and appear "cool". Knowing that a familiar friend was going to be there, I feel a little comfortable. I did things that seemed fun for a while and I woke up. Now I felt a little better after staying in that place for a while. I was never really excited. Just curious. Nothing much happened today, until I met this girl. I didnt know how or what to feel when I first saw her. I knew her by name, but I don't think she knew me. We first exchanged words when the sun fell asleep. I loved how she looked and how she spoke. I didn't think I could converse with her ever that day, but the alcohol broke the ice for us. Prior to meeting this girl I was high and drunk but not to the extent of forgetting and regretting. We had a conversation on the beach that made me feel like the universe wanted it that way. The setting was perfect and so was she. I never expected to fall in love. I only ever realize it when I'm alone.

Religion is the most human representation of what we cannot comprehend. Love is the most human word to describe what we cannot comprehend. Time is the most human representation of the unknown. 

Truth is. Nothing.
