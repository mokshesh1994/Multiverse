      A long time ago ,there was a man ,he once lived in a peacefull village ,the people there considered him crazy or mad ,but no one knew if it was true .The man would always wonder around the village ,holding a vase while saying senseless rubish ,some say it was the artifact that made him crazy ,the people there started to call him Vash for some reason ,the Vash would always hold the vase so firmlly as if it was made of gold .
    One Day ,a groupe of villagers got curious,and decided to take a look inside Vash's vase,but recently the mad man stopped coming to the village ,whenever he came many would notice him ,it's as if they miss him ,so the group ,decided to visit the Vash ,as an excuse to take his vase .At night ,darkness reigned ,there was no moonlight ,just pitchblack ,which only made the group scared but they were determined ,so they crossed the forest next to the village ,they say that the mad man lives at the end .The Group marched ,they eventually made it to Vash's home ;
"yes we did it"one of them said "let's take a look inside" he added . they all seemed to agree ,then one of them said "what if he is awake" but they all ignored him ,and made their way inside anyways .As soon as one of them opened the door it made a very terrifying "squick" sound ,it scared them to the bone ,they can see him The madman ,he was lying at the other end of the room ,the house was made of one room ,their was spider webs ,and dust all over the place .One of them eventually gathered his courage ,and walked up to the asleep man ,he was terrified when he saw the man sleeping with open eyes ,but thank god he was still asleep ,who knows what he would have done if he was awake ,anyway ,the man took the vase quickly and replaced it with an old ragged boot ,he found lying next to him . The group hurried outside the house ,and sheered and they felt victorious , "let's see inside "one of them said as soon as they heard that phrase ,everyone calmed down ,"it's still not over" he added .Then he slowly took the vase from the hands of the one who looted it ,and opened it very fast ,just to find a silver old ring ,and photo of a beautifull woman which was also old ,no one understood anything ,they eventually returned the vase to it's rightfull owner ,leaving no answeres as to why Vash is Crazy ,supposing he is .
