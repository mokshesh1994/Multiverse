  Why is this world so cruel? Henrieta thought to herself as she stabbed the earth repeatedly for food. She was snatched away from her parents at birth. The words she remembers from that day were Shes gonna be a good one! Shes never been able to decipher those words. Henrieta grew up in a cold confined atmosphere. She and the others followed a seemingly arbitrary schedule day after day. She was also forced to do inexplicable things and endure intrusive gropings. 

 The putrid stench she had to deal with when she was forced in to her cage only made things worse. Before she closed her eyes from exhaustion she would mark her rough wooden surface. It was another pointless day. Henrieta felt somewhat unusual on this rainy day. It felt lonelier than normal. 
	
 She saw a grain of food, but after she swiftly took it another appeared, then another and another. She reached the end and was quickly rushed into a red lit room. The vile smell made her tear up. Hours passed but was still alone in this terrible closed off space.  She went to the edge of the room lifted her leg scratched the surface.

 The force caused her to nail break off. Her eye lids shut. Henrieta was too tired to scream too tired to cry. The final words she heard before she went unconscious. We tried but this shit chicken just isnt laying anything! She awoke to darkness, no noise no smell no feeling.
