At my lowest, it was cold and dark. I was alone. Unmotivated to engage in any activities. Unmotivated to even move out of my seat to manage my sustenance. I was an inert lump, an apathetic waste of space depleted of all of whom once enjoyed everything life had to offer. Thinking back on it I might have always been this way and just never accepted it for fact. I was ignorant of the way I was living and just accepted it as a normal habit. That was until I came to realize that what I was doing with my life brought no meaning. There was no next step. I had trapped myself on the one step that I only ever knew. And for a while it was good. Until I wanted more. 

&nbsp;


When I realized that I couldnt go any higher because of my past life decisions, I fell. I fell and fell and fell until I found a step that was comfortable with my inactivity. And I stayed there. Because it was comfortable. Because it was safe. But the world cares little for my personal problems. Everyone around me took the next step and moved on. I use to be with them, sometimes even above them and my arrogance would look down upon the others below me. I would smirk that smug smile I would make. I loved being on top and I still do. But its hard looking down on people when theyre already so much more far above you now. 

&nbsp;


There was a time when I tried to turn all that around. I tried to find my spark again; my enthusiasm to learn. I failed. Then I tried the easy way out. Money. Fast money. It was unsuccessful. For now. Again and again I failed and I failed but after a while I stopped failing. I stopped trying too. Whats the point in continuing to try if I keep failing? So once again I got comfortable where I was. Until one day when I happened upon a little light that gave me hope again. She was the spark. 

&nbsp;


I met her by chance, just a flickering light I met that day along with the many other flickering lights of the evening, but slowly with the course of time and a little care she became more than just a light. She became a flame, a source of warm and comfort. Small as it was, I treasured her flame, cradled it. Every day I would kindle the flame to keep it alive and lit. Every day I cared for the flame as if it were my only respite in this cold, dark world. And the flame was warm. So warm that it ignited the chars within me. Chars that I had almost given up on because I believed them to be exhausted. With my new embers I began to enjoy life once again but not just for myself. I used my new found motivation to look for new and different ways to tend to my flame to keep it thriving and flickering away. In the process, I found that in turn I was digging myself out of the hole I created. I was once again reaching up for that next step. And for a while I was happy.

&nbsp;


But I was careless. Others took notice of my renewed vigor and gathered to take a gander at my flame. They too were taken in by its warmth and I became envious. It was MY flame. No one elses! I burrowed my flame deeper and deeper into my chest, bundling it up so close that it was out of sight of everyone else. And soon everyone left and I once again became comfortable. Comfortable with just tending to the flame. Comfortable with its heat and its warmth. It was once again all mine and no one elses. But a flame belongs to no one. 

&nbsp;


One day it got cold. I opened my arms and my flame was gone. Leaving me with only the burns of its existence. I had smothered it because of my obsession. At first I was confused. Then I denied it to be true. Then I begged and bartered for my flame to be returned. Then I got angry. Then I got sad. And for a while I returned to the cold, dark world I knew all too well. I returned to the step I was comfortable being on. And life went on as it always had. But I grow tired of the cold, of the dark. I miss the light and the warmth of the flame even though I know all too well that it will not return. But I grow tired of the cold, of the dark. I had a taste of the comforts and the excitement the flame brought. I miss the feeling of being alive and thriving again. And I grow tired of the cold, of the dark. Its my turn now to become the spark for my own life, to kindle my own flame, and if ever given the chance, to spark fires in those around me. Thats the lesson the flame taught me in the short time we shared and I still have the burns to prove it. To this day the embers inside me are still only smoldering, but where theres smoke theres always fire.
