I walk into the saloon, at a time when things seem to be very dangerous, in a place where there can be no escape, seeing as there are countless men around me, all of them out for my blood, and I will have to pay the price for my ignorance, because I have done them wrong, have completely destroyed their lives, my ignorance obviously being a major factor, the biggest factor in how I went about stealing from them, taking what they deserved, manipulating them, and, most of all, using them for my own sinister purposes, so I could finally have what many people want, but, more often than not, fail to receive, out of pure bad luck, luck that never seems to change, consistently getting worse, every single day, all nights of the year, no matter the situation, how good the people are, or what they can do for society, this horrible society that we, the citizens of this country, endure with contempt, for the slightest chance that we might, in the future at least, achieve something that will help everyone, not just one person, as is often the case, time and time again, there virtually no end in sight, none that would put a stop to the suffering, to my suffering, and so here I stand, within this saloon, ready for the end as they approach me, contempt in their eyes, hatred that knows no limit, is controlled by no man or woman, of which I can be most thankful for, knowing that their hatred truly belongs to them, as I watch the people around me smoke, drink, and fuck, while I stand here, eagerly awaiting the finish, what will certainly be my final farewell, a truly climatic end to a rotten existence, and, believe me, it has been a rotten existence, consisting of mostly pain, torment, the very meaning of, how should I put this, what it means to be truly miserable, beyond what most people would understand, and so I must stand in this saloon, surrounded by murderers, certain of my demise, and as I try to flee, my heart beating swiftly, the bigger man, the one with the large stomach, violently slams me against the wall, frustration in his eyes, to the point where he can barely stand the anger, for all purposes leaving me without breath, my thoughts full of nothing but emptiness, like they have suddenly been taken from me, by forces that Ill probably never understand, underneath all of this complex violence, and it almost seems fitting, how I spent my entire life searching for something that, things being what they are, never really amounted to anything, which is, I now know, the saddest thing of all.
