The Biggest Letdown

> There he stood. And there I stood. Us. Facing each other. I should have felt scared of the situation or happy because of this recent achievement, but I wasnt. I was confused. All I ever learned was wrong. This should have been the biggest moment in history, but it was too clich. It didnt feel right.
> I, Artom Kara, Trader for the space station Lapasta, was trained in the University for Exploration and Trade, I was taught by the best in their fields, soldiers, politicians, philosophers, economists, miners and especially biologists. All of them, except the latter, taught me things that proved to be right.
> Biologists, and especially those for hypothetical xenobiology, always said that if we ever met an Alien, that he would look not like us. They said we might not even recognize them as a living thing.
> Aliens would probably not see what we see, not make sounds that we could even hear, not think like we do, and especially not look like us.
> But there he stood, two-legged, with five fingers on each of two hands, two eyes and all that.
> I was basically standing in front of a blue human.
> A joke of an alien, looking like he came from an old 1960s Sci-Fi-Movie.
> I couldnt believe it!
> This were the worst last moments of my life. I was furious! I at least hoped that before we fell into the black hole, that I would meet the first real Alien and not a blue guy with antenna!

Note: This is my first short story ever, and because I'm not a native english speaker there will be mistakes or stupid phrasings.
Constructive critisicm wanted!
