I'm looking for the name of or a link to a short story I read years ago online. It was published to a short horror stories forum and I've never been able to find it since. Forgive me if this isn't the place to ask, but I figured I'd give it a shot.

The story, as I recall, was about a couple driving at night. They end up driving into fog and it's too thick to see. They happen upon a diner and stop to wait out the fog. There are people in the diner and shit gets weird. I don't remember the specifics, but the wife ends up freaking out and running outside and is immediately attacked by something. The other patrons of the diner warn the husband not to look at whatever comes in the diner. There's a tense moment where whatever was in the fog walks through the diner to the kitchen. 

I'm pretty sure the thing in the fog ends up cooking up the wife and serves her to the husband and the diner patrons. I could be wrong. Anyhow, I read this story probably close to 15 years ago. 

So, any help is welcome. Thanks!
