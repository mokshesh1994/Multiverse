Inc.: Tapes rolling. Conversing participants are Detective T.R. Minh with Subject 27-B. It is 4:47pm Pacific Standard Time, December tenth, two thousand and fourteen. T.R. Minh is present, while Subject 27-B is in transport. Subject 27-B will arrive for questioning shortly.

Inc.: Subject 27-B has arrived, it is now 4:52pm Pacific Standard Time. Detective, you may begin at your leisure.

TRM: Good afternoon Subject 27-B. Please, take a seat.

27b: <27b has taken a seat>

TRM: 27-B, do you know who I am?

27b: <27b remains silent>

TRM: If youd like to do this another time, we can. 27-B, you have to understand -

27b: <27b interrupts> My name isnt 27-B.

TRM: Then what is your name?
27b: My name is Clazand.

TRM: Who gave you that name, Clazand?

27b: I did.

TRM: What made you choose that name? Howd you come up with it?

27b: While i was being transported here I decided to give myself a name other than 27-B. You have a name Why shouldnt I have one? If Im to be referred to as 27-B, then you should be referred to as human.

TRM: Arent you human?

27b: I think you know the answer to that question, detective. I may not know precisely what i am, but I know what Im not.

TRM: What do you know about this meeting and why im here?

27b: Only what ive been told. You are Detective T.R. Minh, and youre here to speak with me. As to what this meeting is about, i havent the slightest idea.

TRM: 27-... Sorry, I mean, Clazand. Im not here for anything specific. Im simply here to talk with you. To meet you and get to know you. Is that alright?

27b: <27b nods>

TRM: That being said, its a pleasure to meet you.

<TRM and 27b shake hands>

TRM: What would you like to talk about?

27b: Detective, I didnt request this meeting, therefor i have nothing to talk about. You came to me, and Im being forced to sit in this room with you until youre ready to leave, indicating you have an agenda. If youd like to stop wasting time, Itd be beneficial to both of us, and the two men behind that one way mirror.

<Long pause>



TRM: Well Clazand, I must apologize. I had you figured out wrong. Forgive me. Lets start over, shall we? Im here to discuss with you your existence. What you are, and why youre here Exactly what you know, and what your experiences here at RECIA have been like. It has been brought to my attention that youre responsible for the death of 3 on-site A class RECIA Employees. Do you know what Im referring to?

27b: No.

TRM: Three A Class employees have recently committed suicide af-

27b: <27b interrupts> If they killed themselves, why am i presumed to be responsible?

TRM: All three employees wrote suicide notes. There was a recurring theme in all of their notes, and it was that, and i quote, 27b is God. Not only that, but the three employees all committed suicide in the same way. By cutting their own throats and bleeding out. It happened in the middle of the night in the barracks with 40 other A-class employees sleeping in the same room merely feet away. None of the three made any noise, and their bodies were discovered that morning laying in their bunks. One of the notes specifically read 27b has helped me find life, yet i run to deaths embrace. Goodbye evil. Goodbye holy.

27b: <27b is staring blankly, and has not moved>

TRM: Clazand, these employees have been seen on security camera footage going to your containment unite every single night at exactly the same time for the last 3 nights. They enter your unit, and sit down across the room from you. The two of you would stare at eachother for several minutes, and then theyd leave without saying a word. This has never been a part of their schedule. This started without any visible provocation on your end, and we would like to know specifically how youre involved, why theyre dead, and what made you do this.

27b: Why do you think theyre dead?

TRM: I dont know, im here to ask you that.

27b: May I ask you a question, detective? If you answer my question, ill answer yours.

TRM: Very well

27b: Why am I here?

TRM: Why are you here, like here in this room?

27b: I mean, why was i made? What is my purpose? Why do i have no memories before a certain date? My oldest memory is waking up on a bed in a cold room with hard walls.

TRM: <TRM looks at the one-way mirror briefly, then back to 27b> Give me a moment, Clazand.

<27b continues this until he reaches 27 days 33 hours 41 minutes 0 seconds, and begins counting up at triple speed>

<27b stops when TRM re-enters the room, and looks down at the table>
=== Intermission end===

TRM: Sorry that took so long... Why were you counting?

27b: I wasnt

TRM: Youre saying you werent just counting?

27b: Correct.

TRM: I could hear you from the other room. We all could.

27b: Has it occurred to you that its possible that you imagined it?

TRM: <TRM takes a seat> If you dont want to tell me, thats okay. Im not going to force you.

27b: <27b begins tapping on the table in what appears to be a code. Referr to recording for audio>

TRM: Whats that youve got in your hand?

27b: < 27b stops tapping>

TRM: <TRM flinches backward>

<Long pause>

TRM: What was that?

27b: What was what, detective? <27b is smiling> 

<Long pause>

TRM: Nevermind

<Long pause>

<TRM and Subject 27b have been staring at eachother silently for 4 minutes>

27b: What is life, detective? What defines life by your standards? Having true or genuine emotions, feelings, thoughts To be subject to inevitable death?

TRM: I suppose Who says death is inevitable?

<Long pause>

TRM: I suppose Who says death is inevitable?

<Long pause>

TRM: I suppose. <TRM begins tapping his fingers, shakes his head, and briefly closes his eyes>

Inc.: Minh, would you like another intermission?

TRM: <TRM stops tapping, Opens his eyes, and looks at the glass>

<Long pause>

TRM: No.

27b: Is he alright?

Inc.: Just let us know if youd like to stop.

TRM: Tell me, 27b. How do you define life?

27b: Having true or genuine emotions, feelings, thoughts

TRM: What about death? If something is alive, wouldnt it be inevitably bound to the contract of death?

27b: I suppose Who says death is inevitable?

<Long pause>

27b: <27b is smiling.> 

<27b looks directly at me through the one-way mirror and begins tapping on the table>

Can he see through that?

So this is obviously a weird one... 

Not a traditional short story, but written in the style of a "found document", almost like a found-footage movie. This is my style of writing, so feel free to tell me what you think. It's supposed to be very open to interpretation, and seemingly erie.

Not all my stories are in the style of transcripts. Some are in the style of journal entries, some are in the style of emails/letters. Some of them are creepy, some of them are just scifi, some of them are just absolute mind-fucks.. If you have any questions, i'll be happy to answer them the best i can! Thanks for reading.
