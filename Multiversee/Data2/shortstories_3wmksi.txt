To BW: Lovely, Beautiful, Waiting.

Some people tell me I have no idea how to write a story. That it must begin a certain way and end a certain way. If anything it should end with happiness. This is a story where there isnt a happy ending. This is the story of my life and currently... There! You guessed Im not happy.

Chapter 1: Love

Love is a very complicated emotion as you might as well know. It is an emotion that can drive people to the edge or make them do things they shouldnt be doing. Love for me has always been complicated since I could never fully understand it. Even though being a in relationship for a number of years you would think that a person would know the answer to such a question as to what is one thing that got you this far? People come and go without question, some people will make the effort to stay in your life as much as possible, and some will spill their hearts out just to let that person know how they feel. That is love in my opinion if someone is willing to try their best to make things work out even when they know they have messed up the entire time. Didnt work for me but that doesnt mean Ill just stop thinking about it and regret no longer being part of that persons life. Its life and thats ok just remember you are important to someone even if that someone doesnt even know it. You might be that person on the other end of this no longer thinking about that person and thats life. It is a cycle that continues every day and sadly something that likely can never be repaired due to the problems of the past. 

Thanks for reading and as always IBW!
