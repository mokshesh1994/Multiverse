[OC] A Jake to the Past! The Freeze-O-Ree!
Mc_J4K3
Good morning / afternoon / evening / night to all of the humans, sentient life, and alien scum out there in the universe. This thing that you are currently reading is the very first effort of a recap of one of my glorious memories from my ever so glorious past. Now, before we begin, I'll ask you all to take a drink of whatever you may have. Maybe you have some water, perhaps you have some wine. Who knows, maybe you're Jesus himself and can change it midway.

Good. Now that that's settled, I'd like to jump back about five years into the past, back to the good ol' days of 2010 or 2011, I can't quite remember. Now, to those of which who may see this as a cringe story, no need to worry. It's only cringe worthy for the description of myself and how I looked back then that I'll be delving into right about now. So I was around the age of I want to say twelve or thirteen at this point. I was in seventh or eighth grade, I think, and I had been abducted into the local Boy Scout Troop. If you were to look at me today and ask me why I am still involved with the very same Troop after nearly a decade, since my brother was involved years before I was, and the reason why is because of stories like this one I'm about to tell you.

I was a fairly average kid back in middle school, I was into the arts, although I was bad at most of them besides writing. I did always find an excuse to start up a conversation with my friends Brian and James, who were my vein of sanity during seventh grade Art class... Even the thought of my teacher makes me shudder. So, let's look in to what I looked like. I was fairly average height, short black hair, no glasses, I would wear plain, one color t-shirts because that's what I thought was cool back then. So despite all odds, I was not very cringe worthy back then, despite my weight. I wasn't fat, far from it actually. I was mistakenly called anorexic several times in my middle school career, they even called me into the Principal's office once because they were so concerned. I was skinny, not unhealthily so, but keep in mind that I was making my way through puberty and didn't quite get my muscle at that time. It wasn't so bad to the point where if you would drop a lion into the Art class that it would look towards me with genuine concern and ask if it should be calling an adult because it was worried about my health. It would still eat me, but it would take a second to consider if I would provide any decent nutrition.

Now, all of my middle school antics can wait for another day, it was in Art class, however, that I learned of Boy Scouts and the Troop that I'm still in today. We spoke about it with one other person who's name I cannot recall. Brian and James were in the same Troop and invited me to join in as well. I accepted and literally the next weekend was spent on a camping trip. That camping trip... Was not the one I want to talk about. We went and camped at the local Air Force base and learned about all sorts of stuff, y'know, it was cool.

Now this campout came later on in my BSA career. I want to say I was First Class for this camping trip. So, the minimum rank for leadership. We went out to the Air Force base again to get taught by cadets about all sorts of things. If I ever continue this, you'll notice that a lot of camping trips were spent at the Air Force base. and the main goal of that trip was to have a good time and build teamwork skills at: The Freeze-O-Ree! Creative name, for being a campout in mid February, but not appropriate for that year's trip. It was windy, very windy, to the point where people's tents were being blown over. Regardless it was a standard weekend campout. We worked hard, we got fed, and it was overall a wonderful experience. Until we reached the Obstacle Course.

Oh boy! The Obstacle Course was one of the most trying experiences in my life at that point, no kidding. It started with a series of logs we had to tackle, literally. We were told to run at them and get over them as fast as possible using our body weight to throw ourselves over it. Most of us just tanked the hit and climbed over like complete idiots, it was great. Next up was the Reverse Ladder. This obstacle was designed for people with upper body strength that were at least eighteen years old... Not a seventh grade smartass. I still tried though, boy did I try. I tried so many times that two other troops of boys had to pass up the event because I was just so dedicated to get over this stupid ladder. It turned from halting the progress of our troop to an event that people got emotionally invested in. To paint a picture, it was a ladder of logs that you had to climb and get to the top, however after that you needed to climb down the reverse way, the inverse of that wooden log ladder before planting your feet firmly on the ground. It was a twelve foot drop from the top of the ladder to the ground, I'm pretty sure, and I made that drop so many times. So. Many. Times. It got to the point where people were so invested in my performance that other troops started cheering for me. Eventually, a jerkoff troop decided to start climbing, meaning we had to move on, but the guys still were super dedicated to have me succeed. That's when the course hit its stride, the two things we had encountered were for warm ups. We had to go through a series of obstacles, the details of which I can't really remember, to reach a fireman's pole, we slid down and finished the course. Fun Fact: I'm petrified when exposed to great heights. It was a horrific experience where I waited for twenty five minutes at the fireman's pole, trying to psyche myself up to get going and throw myself at it. In the end of the it, I couldn't do it. I was just too scared of heights to get myself to take that plunge. However, in my tears and bruises that came from the Reverse Ladder, the other boys rallied around me. We all came together, they said that they didn't want to do the rest of the obstacle course, that they wanted to go back to camp, patch me up, and celebrate how hard I tried. There I was, the leader of that troop, brought to my knees in thankfulness for the rest of the boys. They helped me back on my feet, we went back to the campsite, and we had hamburgers and Gatorade as three of the guys looked over how terribly I banged myself up.

It has been ever since that day that I feel an immense feeling of gratitude for that Troop. Now here I am, almost ready to get to College, and I'm still helping them out year after year, hoping to make someone else's life like those boys did for me five years ago.
