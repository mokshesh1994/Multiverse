##Culture Shock

There it was:  a solitary tree on the cliff face. This was the land-mark the monks had told him of, it marked the final thousand steps to the valley floor. He had seen the tree once before, three decades ago; then the tree had marked the first thousand steps to the Monastery of the Tei monks. The monks, they were the ancient ones who had taught generations of crass princes the elusive trait of wisdom. His ancestors had lived among the Tei, he had lived among the Tei, and his predecessors would too; for it was necessary the heir to the Knar throne know wisdom. 

---

The valley floor was lush with an untold variety of flora and fauna thats beauty was un-paralleled by even the garden of the royal court. He felt as if he could stay in the valley for another three decades. He might have if he didnt have an obligation to his people. Perhaps he would retire here when his reign ended. No time for such thoughts now. 
He pressed ahead, following the distinct but faint scent of his target. Close now. He tore through the foliage into a vaguely familiar clearing. Near the opposite tree line was a dilapidated cabin; it was only in slightly better condition thirty years ago. What lay nestled against the cabin was the object of his tracking. He approached it, close enough to make out the slow movements of its chest. It was a Bandur, the mount of the royal court. What had given Bandur the prestigious title was their strange ability to hibernate for decades at a time, hibernation that could be toggled on command with proper training; the perfect companion for young heirs who intend to make the company of the Tei. He approached the delicate animal and laid a hand on its flank. Bioluminescence flared on the creatures skin at his touch. In time it would wake from its long slumber, and then he would ride for Capitol, to his throne.

---

The Bandurs hoofs sunk softly into the marshy terrain of the lowlands. The lowlands: the realm of farmers and slaves. The vast agriculture industry here existed for one purpose, that being to serve the voracious needs of Capitol. A break in the tree line; it afforded him a view of at least a dozen paddies, each one complete with a small farm house. Something unusual though: while the paddies were teeming with crops, many of houses were abandoned, left in various states of disrepair. 
While pondering the circumstances of the mass eviction he saw something lumbering lazily forward in a far paddy. He brought his monocular to bear on the target, exited to see a subject of the court that wasnt a mountain recluse. Sitting squarely in his sights was a vast vehicle, green in color and bristling with what he assumed to be farming equipment, behind the broad hood he could make out the translucent brow of his fellow Kanr. He had never seen such a peculiar vehicle issued by the throne; under what circumstances had it been obtained? Then he saw it: on the grill of the vehicle was a sigil unknown to him. It was a yellow animal, its silhouette was similar to that of the Bandur, leaping across a green backdrop. Was it the sigil of a foreign court? Such a thought carried a certain implication.

---

Close now, the damp terrain of the lowlands had long been replaced with the rolling hills that surrounded Capitol. The Bandur grunted as it crested a particularly large foothill. There it was: Capitol! The view from the hill was gorgeous. In the east was the residential district, home to the merchants who would commute west every day in order to staff the bustling markets of the commercial district. Far to the north were the rumbling factories of the industrial district; their assembly lines would be churning out everything from the instruments of pleasure to those of war. All existed to serve what lay in the center of it all: the beating heart of not only Capitol but the entire nation: the royal court. 



His heart skipped a beat, a wave of nausea radiated throughout him; were the Ivory palace had once stood there was nothing. No that was wrong; a vast tower of glass had seemingly replaced the regal palace in its entirety. In a haze of fear and confusion his eyes became unfocused, bringing the entire city back into view. He saw now that his initial impression had been skewed by fond memories of times past. The entire royal district, along with the residential and commercial zones had been largely replaced with smaller varieties of the monolith that dominated his throne. Then the factories, the small specialized buildings that they were had been replaced with sprawling complexes of steel and iron that spewed black smoke into the skies above. Something had changed in his absence, and he doubted it was an artistic revolution in the field of architecture.


---
The light pattering of rain sounded around him, although the vast buildings on his flanks protected him from the droplets. He looked out of the alleyway towards the epicenter of the city; the glass needle in the center reflected the deep oranges of the setting sun. Satisfied with his observations, he settled down behind a nearby dumpster, obscuring him from any passerbys on the street. As a strange cocktail of fear, confusion, and anger descended upon him as he thought of his predicament. It had quickly become obvious that Capitol had been compromised and rebuilt from the ground up; however only speculation could hint at the nature of this intrusion. Perhaps the treacherous Pondt had broken the thousand year pact and marched on Capitol, or maybe the rebels who made their home in the caves of the Tei had finally succeeded in overthrowing the throne. He purged the thoughts from his mind, merely speculation; soon he would discover the true nature of the situation, for when night fell over Capitol he would make his way to were all answers are kept: the Royal Library.

---

Rain poured through the broken window as he carefully stepped over the fragments of glass. What had begun as a spring shower had quickly become a monsoon. The weather mattered not now, moving deeper into the library he took in his surroundings. Yes, despite the modifications of steel and glass his enemy had made to it, this was still the library of his childhood, now to find the answers that lay behind his questions. He traced his hands over the looming bookshelves as he crept forward, following them to the center of building. Rounding one last shelf, the rotunda made itself visible: this was where the students of the academy would go to study after lectures. Fond memories of candle lit studies formed in his mind, in a fit of nostalgia he looked across the rotunda into the study halls. The gravity of the situation returned when he spotted the object of his search. Sitting on a table was a black slab of silicon and aluminum, a net terminal; its monitor cast a warm blue light onto the synthetic wood of the table.



When he had left for the mountains the technology was in its infancy, although being royalty allowed him some limited use of prototypes. Before he left, the court scholars has promised him the technology would be common place upon his return and for once it seemed they had not exaggerated. He took to the device quickly, thankful for his hours of technical study. Soon he had navigated to a sorting engine of a networked archive, its name was presented in colorful, however unreadable, foreign glyphs. He began to enter search terms. Keywords: Kanr  Capitol  Occupation. No applicable results were returned, only vague headlines of an economic protest. Keywords: Kanr  Capitol  Rebellion. Equally useless, however this time a headline caught his eye: Academi security contractors spar with Royalists in Kanr boarder region. The significance of the words had not fully set in, when a high pitched scream jarred him from his research; it came from the fringes of the building. It seemed as if his point of incursion had been discovered, he was on the clock now. He wracked his mind, looking to uncover the circumstances under which Capitol had been turned into such an alien environment. Alien. Keywords: Kanr - First Contact. Applicable results were returned.



Two voices: one feminine, the other masculine, they were engaged in a hushed conversation not far from the study hall; time was of the essence now. He accessed the first result, a series of reports from the royal observatory; they were dated nearly thirty years ago.


**[Entry-001]** Tei mountain observatory 019 has detected a small fast moving object on the fringe of the system  its sudden appearance has been accredited to an observational error  the object has been given the reporting name C13 as will be tagged for further observation.


**[Entry-002]** The academy of theoretical science has notified us of a physical anomaly taking place at the reported coordinates of C13s appearance. Observatories 020 and 099 have been re-tasked for observation of C13.


**[Entry-003]** It has been determined that C13 is under thrust and has undergone a series of maneuvers that will place it in local orbit within 3 months.


The footsteps and whispery voices were growing closer, and with them flashlights that shone hard white light through the spacing of books. He skipped over a number of entries in a move made out of urgency.


**[Entry-019]**  Upon undergoing 15 orbital rotations C13 has adjusted its trajectory so that it will breach the atmosphere in less than 24 hours. Missile Defense authorities have been notified.


**[Entry-020]** C13 has demonstrated atmospheric flight capability and is performing serpentine maneuvers over the eastern ocean. Military authorities have determined that they do not possess any aircraft capable of intercepting C13.


The voices were clearly audible now, they had entered the rotunda. The masculine voice notified its companion of a trail of footsteps. His time was up; he jumped to the end of the reports.


**[Entry-103]** Cryptographers have determined the contents of C13s message. Firstly  the message has confirmed C13s use of n-dimensional technology. Secondly  it is understood that C13s point of origin is a star with the reporting name B6740  the message refers to B6740 as Sol. Lastly  the message states it is the property of the privately owned entity CanFor.ltd and that under federal law the data C13 has recovered will be added to a publically owned database.

 
**[Notice-003]** Under royal order these reports and responsibility of all future reports will be handed over to a royal committee of inquiry.


Any shock that he could display was cut short by a blinding ray of light; turning towards the source he saw the spindly silhouette of a female Kanr. In a moment of mutual confusion he bolted out the other side of the study hall. He entered the labyrinth of books with only his instincts to guide him; behind him the dwindling obscenities of his assailants could be heard. The situation was bad; he saw now that his fellow Kanr had turned collaborator, even worse they now knew of his presence. The time for prowling in the shadows was over, his people needed him, and so he would bring the fight to those from Sol.

---

The peak of the glass edifice that defaced the grounds of the royal court was shrouded above clouds that now spewed torrential rain. He ignored the bone chilling downpour and turned his eyes forward. Across a tundra of concrete was the epicenter of the invaders operation in Capitol, or at least he assumed it was. The building he stood before towered over all others; and if Sol thinking was even remotely similar to that of the Kanr then this would be were the invaders lodged their leaders. A small grin grew across his rain soaked face, what better way to kill a monster than to rend its head from its body? The higher stories of the building where dark, indicating no interior presence, however the ground floor spilled warm light onto the concrete plaza. He stepped onto the fringe of the buildings glow and adjusted himself into a fighting stance. Instinctively he felt for the weapons that hung across his body. Buried deep in his robes where two triple breech pistols; although the armament slung across his back was his preferred choice. A staff cast from the finest steels and forged in the eastern colonies by masters of the trade:  the weapon of a king. Sure of himself and his ability to do battle he called for his adversary.


Come face me Rulers of Sol! You have crossed reality itself and conquered the infinite void to take my throne, now you must face the last hurtle in your quest, the birth right of Kanr. Only the roar of the elements answered his calls for combat. By the pantheon you are honor bound to face me in single combat! Still his opponent dare not reply. It was beginning to look as if he must personally seek out his cowardly foe. No, that wouldnt be necessary; a breach appeared in the smooth glass of the building and a figure emerged, its details hidden in a silhouette cast by the light of its dwelling. Was this the fearsome conqueror of his people? Stepping forward it revealed itself to the wavering light of the moon. It, or rather he, wore strange clothing of synthetic weaves, neither the flowing robes of nobility nor the rags of a slave. Despite the unusual attire the silhouette was undoubtedly that of a Kanr. It seemed as if his true enemy eluded him yet; a collaborator had been sent in their place.


Although corrupted by an accent, it spoke in the tongue of Kanr, This is the private property of the Mondi paper group; youre going to have to leave sir. Did the collaborator think it could dissuade him with mere intimidation? He stifled a laugh; it seemed as if only the dullest of Kanr had turned traitor.


Bring me your masters, dog; I have no affair with the likes of you. 


Look, its Friday and my shifts almost over, just walk away. In a move to emphasize the threat, the collaborator laid a hand on base of his holster. The only answer he received was a tightened grip on the staff, and a covert move for a hidden pistol. He hoped his staff would taste blood; however he felt no qualms regarding the usage of firearms. Sighing, the collaborator answered the unspoken challenge, Whatever floats your boat buddy. The collaborators hand moved past the firearm, instead coming to rest on a thigh mounted sling, crowning the top was the unmistakable handle of a telescopic baton. Leave it to a collaborator to utilize the weapon of villains and thieves. In one fluid motion the collaborator drew and extended the baton, all while positioning himself for optimal usage. A menacing crackling accompanied the now drawn weapon. A challenge of melee had been issued; releasing the pistol he began to circle his would-be opponent. The fight was on.



The collaborator had made an obvious tactical faux pau in even choosing to challenge a staff with a baton. The staff would easily outreach the baton, allowing him to maintain a healthy offensive while his enemy could only hope to dodge and deflect. Such information did not dissuade the collaborator. While he circled and shifted between fighting stances, the collaborator seemed to take no such pretense; instead he marched forward, weapon held high. The crackling grew obnoxiously louder as the collaborator stepped within striking distance. Somewhat amused at the collaborators display of incompetence; he thrust the staff forward, aiming for the mid-riff. Expertly, the collaborator dodged the attack and brought the now hissing weapon down onto the staffs steel body. The moment contact was made between the two weapons: his body seized, all muscles contracting simultaneously in a single stunningly painful movement. He knew the pain only lasted moments, although his hindbrain screamed eternity. The seizing ended with his ability to fight. He collapsed to the ground, still feeling the burning after effects of his overexerted muscles. Rainwater pooled around his thoroughly defeated form as his eyes glazed over; his consciousness drifting into the infinite. The last sensation he felt was the smell of a traditional barbeque in the royal court.

In his childhood the Capitol constabulary had been a running joke among the court. The glorified watchs ranks were equal parts ineffective and corrupt; however, as always the present surprised him. In the post-occupation city it seemed as if Capitols finest had become a force to be reckoned with. Looking past the murky thermoplastic pane he could see the hazy figures of the constabulary busying themselves with the duties of law enforcement. Even in the wee hours of the morning each officer seemed to move with intent through the vast office space. It was unfortunate such an organization was seemingly dedicated to his imprisonment. Feeling only marginally more melancholy than before; he turned back to his quarters. The cell had all the amenities one might expect from such an institution: one drinking fountain, two mattresses, a repugnant smell, and an intoxicated cellmate. Yes, his cellmate: an old and disheveled Kanr that smelt of the strongest spirits. Perhaps such a world weary individual could provide insight on his predicament.
Awake, elder one he demanded. Groggily, the Kanr stirred from his alcohol induced slumber. 


Whats that? His voice was strained although it carried the unmistakable accent of the lowlands; a farmer then.


Your king demands answers; perhaps the old ones such as yourself remain loyal to the throne?


Without making eye contact the old Kanr responded, Afraid Im only loyal to two things son: greenbacks and beer. It seemed as if his assumption was made in error.


So you are collaborating with the conquerors from Sol? 


Confused, the old Kanr took a moment to consider the accusation. I used to work for a Sol company at the CanFor elevator, if thats what you mean.


Unsatisfied by the answer he persisted. Why do you collaborate, why does this whole city collaborate? I have travelled a continent to lead Kanr and upon my return I see only cowards and turncoats. When he received no answer, he continued with the tirade, what do you see in Sol? Are they great warriors, do you find solace in their strength?


Never seen one fight, the Sol PMCs all use drones.


They are diplomats then? Have you been swayed by their silver tongue?


Never seen one, let alone hear one.


So they are engineers? You have been awed by their party tricks?


Meh, you see one n-dimensional drive, youve seen them all.


So what then, why do you abandon your heritage to follow these strangers into the black of space? Exasperated he looked into the old Kanrs eyes, pleading for an answer.



I kind of just liked their way of doing things, you know? It was his turn to be confused; when the old Kanr saw the uncertainty in his cellmates eyes he continued. Thirty years ago I was slated to work a paddy in the lowlands; but why? The royals told us it was for our children, so they could enjoy a better future, horse-shit! So when Sol arrived a lot of Kanr were ready for a change, ready to see what else the universe had to offer: a lot it turns out. They would give us freedom and all we had to do was participate in a little something they called the free market. While the throne offered a better tomorrow, Sol offered a better today.


You overthrew a thousand years worth of tradition for petty coin?


No one overthrew anything, they just went obsolete.

Early morning sunlight reflected off the glass monoliths and through the windows of the diner. From his window side booth, staring across the broad skyline, he felt very small. All things considered he was lucky, for whatever reason the Mondi Company had decided against pressing charges.


May I take you order? A young Kanr stood attentively at the table side; all smiles.


A double-patty hamburger, extra cheese . . . please It was what the old Kanr had recommended.


Right away sir! the waiter scurried away to the kitchen. Looking across the still awakening city he saw the truth now: one could not liberate those who were content.

---

The diner advertised Sol style food and they certainly delivered on the claim, the meal that lay before was truly alien. A slab of wheat, protein, and lactate: all covered in a thin film of grease. Against his better judgement, he took a bite: it wasnt that bad.
