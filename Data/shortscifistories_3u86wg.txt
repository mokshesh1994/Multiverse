[Micro]The Aliens
Bujidou
I went outside when I heard shouts of excitement and panic. The neighbors were gathered around looking towards the sky. We had never seen anything like it before.

We could see it hovering in the distance. Brilliant lights were flashing all over the massive ship. The closer it got, the darker and more ominous it appeared.

Something didn't feel right in the air. The surroundings became too quiet and the hairs on my neck started to rise. It was almost directly above us now.

Some started to panic, running away in the opposite direction. Many stood dumbstruck looking straight up at the alien vessel. A loud boom came from above with a blinding flash. A million tiny things started pouring out of the ship. That's when everything started to melt.
