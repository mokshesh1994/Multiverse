Perception
blinka
The device from deep space parked itself in orbit before orienting its lens towards Los Angeles.  Earth collectively sighed in relief when it was determined that the alien technology was not a weapon, but a probe.  Further analysis revealed that the satellite took a total of 18 weeks worth of images in zeptosecond increments.  The probe then processed the images, chained them together, and sped them up into a single femtosecond long video, which was then transmitted back to the stars.  Something, somewhere, had created a time-lapse of us, so that they might study us at their natural rate of perception.  Otherwise, staring at immobile objects, like these humans here, would get old quick.
