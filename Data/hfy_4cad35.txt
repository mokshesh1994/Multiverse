[OC] [Biotech] The Earth Coalition
ProudAmerikan
Greetings, ya'll. This one's for the category of **Uplift**, though it can certainly be read independently of that as well. Hope you enjoy!

Perhaps it was wrong to think poorly of ones allies, but zSma sometimes felt vaguely uncomfortable when working with humans and the other members of the Coalition.

It wasnt because they were so...individual, really. There were lots of lifeforms whose parts acted independently of the whole, whose group minds were underdeveloped if they existed at all. And just because all common sense and reason dictated it was impossible for such things to be sentient, let alone intelligent enough to go off-planet...well, that didnt mean it was impossible, right? And humans were made up of cells, they had groupthink, they werent entirely alien. They were technically a swarm entity. Technically.

And it wasnt that their individuals were.. unsociable or anything. They were actually quite social beings, compared to the vast majority in the local galactic belt! While her fleet hadnt been directly present, zSma could still remember hearing about their first contacts with the other species in the area. How their first translated messages werent of fragmented madness and war but of peace, knowledge, cooperation.

That was the problem though. Cooperation.

*The Earth Coalition had requested her assistance again. Another claimed system, thought empty and incapable of harboring sentient life, was in fact capable of harboring life. The crystalline blooms that inhabited the argon oceans of the systems farthest planet had opened up another front in Earths war of self-preservation, and it was hoped zSma could add some extra backup to the inevitable fight.*

*The foraging fleet that had initially picked up the message was already entering the first stages of a swarm. A thousand ships bringing in resources from asteroids and planets buzzed around the fleet, attracted by the promise of expansion and growth. From every forager ship, spindle probes elongated to transfer over everything a fleet needed to supply itself: precious metals, radioactive material, carbon slurries and more. Spectrum processing ships managed innumerable incoming and outgoing signatures, replicating wavelength triggers to where they needed to go. Processing bays and refining stations, triggered into action by the influx of material and triggers, sped up production. A resulting glut of resources swelled the stocks of the nursery ships, and as the breeder castes put out more offspring more former foragers began to modify their ships for combat.* 

*The oldest of the ships - those whose hulls were weakest and most damaged, whose crews had already spent many months doing their jobs collecting food and resources to keep zSma alive and healthy - were already reworking their engines in preparation for their final runs. They would be the scouts to make sure the way was clear, and they would burrow a hole through space for the fleet to follow.*

Of course intra-cooperation among ones constituent minds was a mandatory step in evolving towards sapience and civilization, no collective could argue that. As a species developed and filled ecological niches, its individuals would face challenges from the environment, themselves, and other species. Successful protominds learned to exploit the environment, erase division within their constituent parts, and eradicate all other competition in their race to fill all possible planetary niches. Once they solved those problems, they could finally enter space and develop as a real person.

But Earth...the humans didnt have that at all. When theyd first made contact, each ship tried to talk separately. There was no mind created from the chaos, no unified conscience! A thousand voices, dissonant and fragmented. And yet...theyd made contact. Tried to make contact, at least. 

zSma had tried to explain it to their representatives once. Imagine someone that looked like you, but was not a whole person. Each one of their cells its own distinct entity, wriggling and acting and  talking and *thinking*. Nothing in control. Nothing sapient. SHE was fine with it, really, but the humans couldnt really blame the other powers for seeing Earth as an abomination.

Worse, they hadnt finished killing everything else off on their planet yet either.

*The scouts were the first to enter the disputed system. They appeared as pinpoints of blazing light burrowing out from the space in between stars, bodies disintegrating even as they came back into normal space. Each scout burned a trail in between stars with their own ship as a torch, over-exerting their engines until the heat vented was high enough to destroy them in the process.*

*Their sacrifice, however, opened the way for the rest of the fleet to swarm through.*

*The soldiers were next to arrive, entering space through the tunnels created by the scouts. Delicate graspers and scrapers once used to collect space debris were now hidden by armour plating and fiber wrappings, bulkheads reinforced and new sensor arrays bristling for any signs of other activity. And activity there was: two distinct signatures, one clustered around the farthest planet and one in open space sunward. Weapon mounts unsheathed in anticipation.*

*The former signature was unfamiliar, but unmistakably came from the native inhabitant of the system: the same subsignals repeating between each scandium superstructure slowly rising from the planets orbit, a persons entire body reacting in response to a threat. Hostile. The latter signatures, on the contrary, were all too familiar: the chaotic, disorganized, constant unending chatter and broadcast coming from a hundred mouths and ships of all types. Command pods floating lazily in the void, missile guiders cooling off in preparation of the battle to come, almost-silent observation platforms picking up and transmitting data back to the others. The Earth Coalition. Not-Hostile. Contact and regroup.*

*And after the scouts and the soldiers, the bulk of the fleet entered. Bulbous and ponderous, the vulnerable organs of the fleet - Refineries, nurseries, spectrum processors, generators - emerged slowly through the subspace tunnels. All around them foragers and transports clustered and clung, their tiny hulls acting as a final defensive barrier in case of attack. As the soldiers spread out to ensure her protection, zSma moved to link her ships with those of the Earths.*

Theyd called themselves a Coalition. An alliance between different groups, different nations, different *species*. 

The humans had spread and thrived across the surface of Earth. But they had done so with other species. Companion animals theyd bred from wild stock to help them hunt, help them travel, keep them company. Wild creatures that had adapted to their cities and their lives as much as humans adapted to the earth's. Humans lived...alongside life. Cats and dogs, cows and chickens, pigeons and cockroaches, rats and monkeys, these and more were part of their daily existence. And there were other species, too. Dolphins. Chimpanzees. Crows. Octopi. Species that were social and intelligent and who could sometimes surprise even humanity.

So what did the humans do? They raised them in their own image.

The humans made a breakthrough in neurobiology: Larry the neochimp was the hot topic of their 2063. The humans wanted to achieve a closer connection to their oldest genetic friends: advancements in neuromechanics and biomarketing created the first cyberdog for commercial sale. The humans wanted helpers to assist them in the rebuilding of the devastated oceans: the endangered cetacean species found rebirth and uplift. The humans, only barely able to play within the boundaries of their own star system, were sociable and lonely. So they uplifted other species to keep them company. 

The humans could kill off everything else on Earth had they put some real thought into it but all they apparently wanted to do was create. It was abnormal.

The first fleet to ever make contact with an alien species consisted of five humans, eight dogs, four dolphins, and a chimp. Theyd been some of the first explorers to other star systems, encountered the DoGi on an expansion cycle, and sent out a data packet that turned out to be a series of divergent equations that only became solved if you put them within each other. The DoGis response, one of wary greeting followed by immense disgust, made the fleet also the first to die in combat with an alien species. 

This would prove to be the rule, not the exception, when it came to aliens. 

By the time zSma became aware of the assorted sapient (natural or otherwise) species of Earth, they were already engaged in war against at least twenty-four other species. This wasnt the orderly, methodical, strategic war that other beings engaged in when they occasionally encountered one another in a system: this was extermination. By aligning herself with the Earth Coalition when she did, zSma found herself fighting people she hadnt been at war with in centuries: shy quiet ]drrdgrn[, flighty and excitable MIMIMIMI, even the venerable and long-passive xXlIO_OIlXx had reacted poorly to the humans and their friends.

And yet here she was. Allied with a group of brain-dead species that violated all the norms of sapient thought, including the one that made them all to not feel alone. Fighting alongside them.

*Helping* them.

*The Earth had sent a small force, as was their way: perhaps forty vessels at most, all of them soldiers or scouts, and the whole thing linked together by the most rudimentary of communication systems. Each ship had its own command structure of individuals, all of whom had to make interdependent decisions based on internal and external data and all of whom had to them express these decisions to each other and then take action. All of them were dwarfed in comparison to just one of the natives superstructures currently leaving orbit, linked to the other superstructures in a near-instantaneous group mind whose collective thoughts and actions were made at the speed of light.*

*But zSma was already now moving into position to reinforce her allies, soldiers intermingling with those of the Earths and foragers buzzing in every axis to begin surveying and excavating of new system resources. The first generation of new drones emerged in the first generation of new ships, still glistening with birth fluids and birth oils respectively as they made their inaugural flights. From each spectrum processor the same message was relayed simultaneously towards the Earth Coalition ships: several mathematical equations, only solved when put within each other.* 

*They dutifully responded back, a buzz of divergent conflicting responses that, nevertheless, indicated the feeling was mutual. And both fleets joined together. Octopi and crow-crewed reconnaissance platforms relayed their observations back to spectrum processors and command pods alike. The dog packs and dolphin pods that operated the missile guiders compared attack trajectories to ensure minimal friendly fire. Chimpanzee and human crews directed new logistics plans to account for the bounty of resources zSma had brought with her.*

*They did not make idle chatter beyond the first round of messages. zSma did not enjoy listening to the sound of multiple micro-entities all trying to talk at once, and neither the humans nor their companions enjoyed the idea of interacting with a being that thought and acted on a scale far above their own.*

*Only one Earth vessel, asymmetric and radial and misshapen, dared to contact her. Another type of guider, though instead of missiles it guided engineering drones: the species that piloted it was good at coordination, but not at hunting. The message came through on a private channel to her spectrum processors, repeated every few minutes as the crew could send out. zSma didnt know if it was the same ship that had been part of her first contact with the Coalition, but the species and the message was the same: word spread fast among their kind. Through the recon reports and the tactical models and the materials charts, through the planning for the battle to come, it kept sending out the same message to her spectrum processors: the humans equations, her equations, and then a jumbled mix of the two together.*

Really, it was luck that had brought the Earth Coalition and her together.

Perhaps, if zSma had been approached like the others had, she would not be here. Perhaps she too would have been put off by the sheer affront to decent thought that was the idea of humanity and their ilk, and never would have gotten to know the slightly less horrific reality under the surface.

Yes, the humans lacked a group mind. They were disorderly, disunited, and cunning all at the same time. And so too were their children. The cetaceans, the apes, the canines, the molluscs, the avians, almost all of them were in the same boat.

But not all.

zSma hadnt been approached by any of those species. Shed been approached by an experiment. An experiment made post-first contact, after the humans had it explained to them why they were an abomination against nature. Shed been approached by a species that had been with man since the beginning, but had only recently been considered as a potential candidate for uplift. 

Their first message was much like the others: a series of equations, only solved when placed inside each other. *We work together*. But there was something else added: a whole equation at the end, and then the two put together. *I am a whole being, but I work with them.* 

That was what had decided her response.

Shed later figured there had to be at least something to the humans after all, if their Earth Coalition could produce so charming and precocious a species as the uplifted spacefarer ant.

*All around the farthest planet, the ships of the systems inhabitant spread out. Superstructures opened to reveal mazes of crystal and glass. Soft glows of light rippled through their hulls, and scanners registered electromagnetic radiation spikes. They were almost within the maximum course correction range of the missile guiders. It was a waiting game, now.* 

*zSma was calm. She was always introspective before battle, but now that it was almost time there was only resolve. The Coalition of Earth was her Coalition too now, and this was the type of enemy shed grown up learning to fight.*

*The humans, apes, dogs, dolphins, octopi, and crows of the Coalition were calm. The beings of Earth had entered space, and found it far stranger than they had expected. Theyd made enemies, but theyd also found friends. They saw the enormous ships before them, and saw the teeming ships around them, and knew that for better or worse they were a part of this world now.*

*Ant Colony X-22 was scared and elated. Nir component ants had received the chemical pheromones that meant human-friend and zSma-friend, but other areas had received doses of hostile-enemy. That meant a fight - the colonys first. But ned be fighting alongside human and zSma, creator and like-minded friend, and together everyone would succeed and expand and spread.*

*And the consciousness spread throughout a planets worth of crystalline algae and a solar network of starships was starting to fire up their lasers. They were angry. They were on home ground. Their starships dwarfed those of the Earth and zSma alike, and they could coordinate every action at the speed of thought.*

*But they were only one. And the Earth Coalition was many.*
