The death beast
FelixJarl
Upon a small holopad was a Knnorian war beast. 6,000 Kilos of natural plating and talons with the largest spotted being 11,800 kilos. Top speed of 120 Km/h. A unit found in most armies and almost no war fought without them being deployed


Apparently the Humans consider it a delicacy now.
