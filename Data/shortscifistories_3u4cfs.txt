Roses in December
StanleyScience
The clot reached your brain.  I died along with it.  Memories of our love winked out of existence.  Although I still had them.

Now I was a stranger.  Cold and dark neurons, lifeless inside your head.

They offered me a choice: give them up or hold on.  Who should have the roses in December?

You could not speak and I loved you.  Transplant them!  With urgency they cut them out, to bring you home.

Now I see your face.  I am confused.  We are related, but I can't understand.  Quantum particles now only in your head.

The brief twilight of our lives could never eclipse our love.  Now our particles intermingle, and we are one.
