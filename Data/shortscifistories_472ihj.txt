It's hard to make a baby.

I never thought about how hard it is to make a baby. How time consuming it is. How many things can go wrong.

For most of us, it takes two people months of trying to get pregnant. Some never do. Some never even want to. Then the female spends the better part of a year with the baby growing inside her. Inside her! She has to carry the thing around, losing mobility by the day. She needs more food. Needs more care. Needs constant protection.

It takes a team of people to deliver the offspring. Not friends or family, but specialists who train for years just to get good at it. Childbirth is painful and can sometimes last a whole day, exhausting everyone involved. And most of the time its for a single baby. No litter. No brood. Just one.

The specialists go home, but the parents job is only beginning. A baby is useless for years. Cant run, or even walk. Cant communicate. Definitely cant defend itself. Mom and dad have to give it constant supervision for half a decade, and support it even longer. Help it survive and grow strong. Feed it, clothe it, teach it. Any instincts it does have are practically useless. Its basest one? To cry out in a shrill screech, telling everyone within a kilometre where it is.

The truth is, its hard to make a baby because the evolutionary pressure isnt on. We think its good enough, and, as far as life on Earth goes, it is.

But I never realized just how stunningly inefficient we are until I studied the sample the rover brought home. Watched it procreate asexually just seconds after birth, steal nutrients out of the air, breed thousands of copies at once. Watched it quickly fill the testing room with writhing, rat-sized bodies, each attacking the glass just minutes after birth.

That's when I realized that weve lost.
