[30000] Changing the Rules
AluminiumComet
*Hello again!*  
*Just another idea I had a while ago and decided to turn into a story; thought it was okay, then went and read some more HFY stories and was reminded of how far I am from attaining that standard of writing. Also, I never realised until now just how difficult speeches are to write!*  
*Anyway, hope you all enjoy. Im always looking to improve, so constructive criticism is much appreciated. (Thought I may as well enter it into the 30,000 contest while its still running)*  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
How many?  
Looks likeabout thirty thousand, the sensors officer said.  
There was a chorus of nervous muttering amongst the crew of the flag bridge aboard the TAS *Unrelenting*, and Admiral Thomas Bell stroked the stubble on his chin, thinking.  
Order the fleet to hold positon, he eventually said. We want them to come to us. And engineering, I want our jump drive charged up and ready to go when they enter range.  
Charging jump drive, aye, the tactical officer said.  
This was going to be one hell of a fight.

Jump complete, Captain.  
Captain Nazmin Uddin of the TASS *Resolution* nodded in acknowledgement. Navigation, she said, where are we?  
One second captain, the navigation officer said, fingers flying across the keyboard of his console. Looks like were in 61 Cygni. Binary star system, no planets as far as I can tell.  
Very good, Lieutenant. Find us another jump point and prepare to-  
Shit!  
Lieutenant? Captain Uddin warned, frowning.  
Sorry, Captain, but I think theres something wrong with my sensors.  
What makes you say that, Lieutenant? She asked, beginning to feel uneasy.  
Welltheyre saying theres another ship in the system.  
Impossible, Lieutenant, the Captain said, as much to reassure herself as anything. This system is in an unexplored sector of space. No human has ever been here before.  
Im sorry, Captain, but I think you misunderstand me. This doesnt look like a Terran ship.  
Those were not words Captain Uddin wanted to hear. For decades, humanity had dreamed of this moment, and as they began their slow expansion out into the galaxy it had seemed more and more likely that someday, intelligent alien life would be encountered. But Uddin? She was one of the few who dreaded finding aliens. She enjoyed the freedom of exploring places where nobody had ever been before, and being the Captain of a survey ship meant that she could effectively do anything she wanted without repercussions. Her ship would spend years on end exploring space far away from civilisation, able to go anywhere without fear of upsetting anyone. Aliens would get in the way of that, she thought.  
And so, naturally, she was sceptical.  
Sensors, I want three sensor drones launched. Theres no way *their* sensors can be faulty as well as ours.  
Launching drones, aye.  
Comms, I want a courier drone sent back through the jump node, just in case. Upload all of the data weve gathered, and set it for Sirius.  
Launching courier drone, aye.  
With that done, there was nothing left to do but wait. The sensor drones launched, their ion drives slowly accelerating them away from the *Resolution*, placing them in slightly differing orbits. Their sensors activated, sending a three-dimensional map of their immediate vicinity to the ship.  
Confirmed, the sensors officer said, one unidentified vessel at a distance of half an AU.  
*Damn it.* Ok, Communications, broadcast the first contact message, all frequencies.  
Broadcasting first contact message, aye.  
Captain Uddin interlaced her fingers and leant forwards, elbows on her console. Eight minutes passed as she waited in anticipation for their response. A response that never came.  
Of course, shed been expecting there may be a bit of a delay before a direct response was received. After all, they would have to translate the data transmitted by the Terran ship into something readable on their computers, but shed at least thought they might recognise the message as from intelligent life and reply with their own first contact package. No such response came.  
Twenty minutes after they had sent their message, they finally received a reply. Though it wasnt the one theyd been expecting, it sent a pretty clear message. As her ship disintegrated around her, Captain Uddins last thought was that shed been right about the aliens all along.

**Present Day**  
&nbsp;  
Alpha Centauri. A binary star system, a mere four light years from Sol, and the place where the first extrasolar colony had been founded. Not an easy place to live, for sure, but despite that, it was now the most heavily populated system outside of Sol itself. It was also now the *only* populated system outside of Sol.  
And so this was to be their last stand, as the two hundred ships of Task Force 23 stood alone against the alien armada. A mishmash of old and incomplete military ships and freighters with weapons hastily bolted on, humanitys last hope against thirty thousand alien warships, just one of which had wiped out entire fleets by itself. The largest force the Terran Alliance had been able to muster.  
God help us, Admiral Bell heard one of his crew whisper, as the alien ships grew bigger on the view screen.  
Not even God can help us now, he said.

Unidentified starship: this is Rear Admiral Clark of the Terran Alliance Navy. You are trespassing in our space. Turn back now or you will be fired upon. I say again, if you do not leave our space immediately we will be forced to open fire.  
The alien starship did not reply, instead continuing its advance towards the Ross 428 systems sole colony.  
Fire a warning shot, Rear Admiral Clark said, show em we mean business.  
Most of the crew of Task Force 7 didnt understand why he was so keen to negotiate with them  these bastards had wiped out the colony in Sirius: the smallest colony, sure, but it had still had over a hundred thousand inhabitants  but months of training and years of experience meant that they followed his orders without question, regardless of their personal feelings. After all, they reasoned, Admirals knew things they didnt.  
The TAS *Executioner* shook at its primary railgun fired, its engines giving a short burn to compensate for the recoil. Five tonnes of iron soared through space, missing the prow of the alien ship by a relative hairs breadth, but did nothing to slow its advance towards the colony.  
Taking his head in his hands, Rear Admiral Clark gave the order hed been dreading since being given this assignment. Contact all ships in the fleet, he said. Designate unidentified ship as Hostile and order them to fire a volley at the enemy.
As his communications officer relayed his order to the rest of the fleet, Clark stared at the image of the ship on the display. He had no issues taking a fleet into combat, of course. He had done so on many occasions previously, but this felt*different*, somehow. All those times before hed been facing pirates and terrorists, but now he could well be firing the first shots in what might end up being a long and bloody war. And though he knew that, in truth, the ship he was looking at now had shot first, when it wiped out Sirius, he still felt like giving the order to kill potentially hundreds of sapient life forms he knew nothing about was wrong.  
The *Executioner* vibrated rapidly as its railguns and missiles fired, and, looking down at his console, he could see that the rest of the fleet was doing the same. The ship groaned and screeched as its engines battled against the recoil of the weapons spewing death towards the enemy. Metal and fire rained down on the alien ship, the ships sensors temporarily blinded by the intense light of nuclear explosions.  
Is the hostile destroyed, Lieutenant Commander? Read Admiral Clark asked his sensors officer.  
One momentahnegative. Hostile is still functioning.  
Before Clark could give the order to fire a second volley, beams of light lanced out from the hostile ship and cut through the ships of his fleet as though their armour wasnt even there. He could only watch as, beams of light danced amongst his fleet, ripping the ships of Task Force 7 apart. The flag bridges main viewscreen lit up in a brilliant blinding white light, then everything went black.

Enemy entering weapons range now, Admiral, the sensors officer said.  
Admiral Bell nodded. *This had better work.* Engineering, he said, is the jump drive charged?  
Affirmative, Admiral. Its ready to activate on your command.  
Good, the Admiral paused for a moment, then pressed a button on his console, putting him on the fleet-wide communications network. He cleared his throat. As youre all aware by now, he said, Im not much good at speeches. But all the other Admirals seem to think theyre a good idea, so I thought Id give it a go.  
Out there is the worst enemy we have ever faced as a species. They have already killed millions of our fellow humans; our friends, family, sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers. Sirius, Ross 248, Ross 158, Luyten 726-8, Lalande 21185, Wolf 359, WISE 0855-0714, Luhman 16, Barnards Star. They will be remembered. Today, here, now, they will be avenged.  
If we fail today, then once they are done murdering the innocent people inhabiting this system, there will be nothing standing between them and Sol. We are humanitys last hope. We cannot fail.  
And so here we are. Outnumbered. Outgunned. The enemy is better than us in almost every way, and so far undefeated. But let me tell you now: we can beat them. And we *will* beat them. We stand here, one ship to every one hundred and fifty of theirs, so that we can send them a message. A message of two words: no more! Their reign of terror has gone on long enough! They have pushed us around for too long and, one way or another, This. Ends. Here!  
He paused, looking around the flag bridge at the crew under his command. They were all watching him intently, admiration in their eyes; some nodded determinedly in agreement.  
Now man your battle stations, and show those alien motherfuckers that they have picked a fight with the wrong species. This has been Admiral Thomas Bell of the Terran Alliance Fleet. Thank you.  
He disconnected from the fleet-wide comm network, then looked at his crew again.  
Just in case this doesnt work, he said, I want you all to know that its been an honour serving alongside every one of you. Now, engineering, activate that jump drive. Lets save our people, eh?  
Aye, sir, the engineering officer said, pressing a button on his console.  
Outside the ships of Task Force 23, a tear in the fabric of spacetime itself opened. At first glance, it looked just like any of the dozens of other such tears that were opened by Terran starships every day, but in reality, this one was very, very different. It grew from an infinitesimally small point to an enormous distortion encompassing the entirety of Task Force 23 and the alien armada facing them, then vanished as quickly as it had appeared, taking all 30,200 ships with it.

Did you listen to a word I just said? Doctor Cristina Corvin hissed.  
Look, Doctor, Admiral Bell said. Im going to make this very simple for you. Have you, or have you not found a way for us to travel faster than the enemys ships?  
No, but-  
Then we have nothing further to discuss, Bell turned to leave, moving to put his cap on his head, when Doctor Corvin grabbed his arm.  
Would you just listen to me? she said. Admiral Bell was about to scold her for this act of insubordination, but she was talking again before he got the chance to speak. We havent found a way to travel faster, but what we *have* found is perhaps far more important. We now have a way of using our existing jump drive technology to travel between universes.  
I understand that Doctor, Admiral Bell said, angrily, and Ill admit that this would be a very interesting discovery if we werent at war, but we are currently facing the extinction of our species and we cannot afford to be wasting resources on-  
If you would just *let me finish*, Doctor Corvin snarled, Ill tell you why its important.  
As Im sure youre aware, we believe that all of the aliens advanced technology - power, propulsion, shields, weapons, the lot  works due to whats known as the Fowler Effect.  
Yes, but Im not sure what thats got to do with-  
What Im trying to tell you is that the laws of physics are against us here. We cannot win by following the rules, and these rules govern the entire universe; theres no way to break them. So if we cant win by following the rules, and we cant break the rules, what do we have left?  
Doctor Corwin paused and looked at Admiral Bell expectantly.  
I give up, Doctor, he said. Tell me.  
She smirked. Changing the rules. What if I told you that some of the parallel universes weve been discovering have different laws of physics to our own? Some so different that life as we know it could never survive, but others only slightly different?  
Are you saying we could use that as a weapon? Transport the enemy into one of these universes where life cant survive?  
No. We know next to nothing about our enemy, so for all we know, they could have come from one of those universes and found a way to survive in ours, or they could be robots that can survive there. And if they survive, they could get back to our universe. No, I have a much better idea.  
Which is?  
Doctor Corvin grinned. We find a universe where the laws of physics are just very slightly different. Not so different that we cant survive, but different enough that the Fowler Effect doesnt exist, meaning their technology wont workbut ours will. We then transport the enemy ships there along with one of our own fleets; all being well, we should be able to destroy the disabled enemy ships without losing any of our own, then return to our universe once the jobs done.  
You make it sound so easy  
Easy? No. But possible? Absolutely, and, I believe, our only option.  
So you *can* do this? How long will it take you?  
I can get a prototype done in about six months, a production model in maybe double that.  
I want the prototype in three. No longer.  
Im not sure I can-  
Youd better find a way, Admiral Bell said, turning to leave and putting his cap on his head, for all our sakes.  
Bell walked through the corridors of the research facility, a grim expression on his face. The aliens hadnt been seen or heard from since they destroyed the colonies in the Barnards Star system, but now he was receiving troubling reports from long-range reconnaissance of the aliens amassing a fleet in the Luhman 16 system, and intelligence suspected that theyd be ready to hit Alpha Centauri in just over three months. If Doctor Corvin could have her prototype ready by then, maybe, just maybe, the Terran Alliance stood a chance of beating the aliens. If not  
*Id rather not think about that.*

**Present Day**  
&nbsp;  
Admiral Bell looked around the flag bridge of the *Unrelenting*, his head throbbing. That jump had taken its toll on the ships and crew of Task Force 23, but then, that jump hadnt been the same as any of the countless others theyd been through before.  
Where are we? he groaned.  
Err, the navigation officer said, still in Alpha Centauri. Same position as before.  
If the rest of the fleet okay?  
Affirmative. All ships have reported in. Reporting some minor injuries due to crew members passing out, but nothing too serious.  
*Well thank Sol for that*. Bell nodded. Now was the time to ask the question he was dreading hearing the answer to. Status of the enemy fleet? he asked.  
It looks like theyre*disabled*. Theyre just drifting, lifelessly. Im not getting any energy readings from them at all.  
*Well Ill be damned*, Bell thought, a grin breaking out on his face, *that crazy eggheads idea actually worked*.  
Tactical! he shouted. Link the rest of the ships fire controls into your console. I want a firing solution targeting all thirty thousand of the enemy ships, and I want every last one of them reduced to dust by the time we run out of ammo.  
Creating firing solution, aye.  
After a few seconds, the tactical officer announced that the computer had calculated a firing solution. Bell leaned forwards and said, Fire railguns, one projectile per enemy ship.  
Firing railguns, aye.  
The ships of Task Force 23 lurched as iron rods shot out of their railguns, flying towards the alien ships on a ballistic trajectory and punching through their armour as if it was made of tissue paper. The ships then reloaded their railguns, rotated slightly, and fired at their next targets. Then again. And again. For ten minutes, the ships of Task Force 23 fired their railguns, expending half of their ammunition, and by the time they had finished, every single one of the enemy ships had an enormous gaping hole torn through its hull, and was drifting and spinning wildly through space.  
Admiral Bell stared at the view screen, open-mouthed. His enemy, feared for two years throughout Terran Alliance space, lay beaten before him. He kept expecting this to be a trick; maybe these were just unshielded decoys, and another fleet would jump in any second now, or perhaps they would suddenly stabilise, as holographic projections of battle damage flickered off, and continue their advance towards his fleet. It seemed like it had been too easy.  
I guess their shields were so strong that they didnt bother with armour, one of his crew said, entranced by the destruction visible on the screen.  
Its not over yet, Admiral Bell murmured, turning to his tactical officer. Tactical, I want missiles on as many of the ships as you can manage, nukes on the big ones, conventional on the small ones. Try to hit them inside the holes weve already caused, and once were out of missiles, finish the rest off with railguns.  
Firing missiles, aye.  
The tactical officer punched commands into his console, and, once again, the ships of Task Force 23 rocked and lurched as missile tubes and railguns unleashed their payloads on the hostile fleet. Nuclear fire blinded their sensors as the larger enemy ships were vaporised; the rest were reduced to dust by explosions and kinetic impacts, and, as the view screen cleared, Admiral Bell could only stare in awe at the wreckage of the once-mighty fleet before him.  
Nobody said a word. They just watched in disbelief as the debris broke apart, signalling the end of a war that had claimed the lives of millions of people. It didnt seem real. Perhaps this was just a dream, Bell thought, or maybe hed failed, his fleet ground into the dirt like ants, and this was Heaven.  
We did it, someone laughed. We actually fucking did it!  
That broke everyone out of their trances, as they leapt out of their seats and cheered, punching the air, hugging, patting each other on the back; several of the crew walked up to Bell and shook his hand vigorously, followed by the most perfect salutes he had ever seen, despite his insistence that it was unnecessary, that they had earned a bit of informality.  
Finally, as the celebrations began to die down, he stood up and cleared his throat. May I have your attention, please, he shouted. Ill admit, a large part of me believed that this day would never come. I thought this plan, this insane, audacious plan, would surely fail.  
I have never been happier to be proven wrong.  
For two long years we fought, and for two long years we were crushed under the heel of these interstellar giants. But today, through grit, determination, ingenuity and skill, we have prevailed.  
Do not go home viewing this as my victory; all of you played a vital role in securing a future for our people, and this victory belongs as much to each and every one of you as it does to me. Never forget that. For all you have done, I thank you.  
Now if you would all please return to your seats. Engineering: activate the jump drive; take us home.
