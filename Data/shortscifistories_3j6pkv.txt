Arkship Babel [x-post /r/shortscarystories]

The pristine ship glinted silently in the darkness. Its clean white hull was marred only by the comparatively tiny nameplate, about the size of a city block bearing the name, "Babel". The ship gleamed quietly, shining as peacefully as the day it was built in the light of a nearby star. Being assembled by drones in orbit did give it the unique advantage of having never saw or felt the fouling cover of the dirt and dust of its home planet, long since left behind.

The ship was an incalculably expensive technological marvel, the result of an entire planets material and power production for the greater part of two generations. It made sense of course, everything left behind was slag in space, but the ship itself was all the more grand for not having any expense spared. So it stood, a noiseless beacon white beacon on a black backdrop, a symbol of what a planet united could achieve.

The hard white shell covered a soft, but no less spotless interior containing solidly frozen humans, plants and animals of every species, color and creed. Their centuries-long slumber was just as still as the vacuum surrounding them.

But for the first time since there was a planet beneath them, something stirred. The mute exodus had reached its Zion, and a deafening hissing of pressure being released and liquid gasses evaporating filled the halls that hadn't heard or seen movement in so long. Medical machines that would be considered miracle workers dutifully attended their charges as they had been waiting for centuries to do.

In a comparative blink of an eye, the voyage was over as quickly as it had began, bookended by a low, stable orbit above a lush planet. The ship had completed the longest trek ever undertaken without a peep or hiccup and waited almost triumphantly for its precious cargo to make their first bold steps into the future.

And it waited, as silent as it had been for centuries.
