WAR Planet: Part 2
Gallifreyggle
2000 years later Webb returns to Earth.

The communicator screen lit up as three Galaris in full military regalia appeared in a white room presumably on Earth. 
All honor to The Royal Highpriest and the Wonderful Counselor, on behalf of the Reconnaissance Unit of the Official Galaris Military we submit a comprehensive analysis of the War Planet for your review.

Webb nodded for them to proceed. 
In summary, we evaluate the project to develop human soldiers ultimately as a failure. Over time, humans have worked cooperatively to build civilizations that are organized cohesive and nonviolent; a trend that began after the fall of the Roman Empire. The war culture we hoped to breed never took root. Humans see war as strategic and not immediately beneficial as human life is highly valued. The average human does not even exercise its violent faculties needed to be an effective soldier. However, there is still contention and various uprisings amongst small people groups.

Webb stood in deep reflection. If this failed he would never be able to end the Talaverian War, and so much was sacrificed in vain. He asked them, What do you recommend?
The Galaris soldiers looked at each other and one spoke slowly. There are a select group of people that we recommend preceding with the harvest. They have a history of conquests and sacrifice for the greater good of the community. Their faith continuously pushes them to the limits of human capacity. We feel that with proper training and effective leadership they would make great soldiers.
He was curious to know what humans could possibly rise out of the persistent push towards nonviolence. He asked, Who are these people?
The soldiers replied in unison, Those that follow Jesus.
Webb smiled, turned to his right and said to his son, Well done.
