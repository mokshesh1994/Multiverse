**To my readers:**

With *the* Meta post a while back and all of the subsequent discussions about what HFY is or isn't, and what cliches are worn out, I really wasn't sure if I should submit this story.  I must confess that the general sentiment of this sub has changed since I subscribed, so the following story falls under the *Atypical* category.  I know it's a slow build and humans don't enter the fold immediately, but please stick with me and I think you'll be pleased.  I've been sitting on this for a while, and I have more chapters in hand, so love it or hate it, please let me know!

**Chapter 1**

Those civilizations that sprouted near the galactic core had the benefit of wonderful and ever-present neighbors.  Each new addition to our community heralded a surge in prosperity for all.  What began as a chance encounter between two civilizations eons ago has grown into a bustling alliance between just over forty.  Sure, there have been territorial skirmishes and acts of rogue piracy, but reason always prevails and coalitions spring up as neutral intermediaries to combat land grabs and feuds.  It is our duty as a family to look out for each other despite our differences.  Threats to that peace are terminated with swift and extreme prejudice.

&nbsp;

We Veldians were the newcomers to the neighborhood.  Our discovery of radio astronomy revealed far more than background radiation and before we had time to come to terms with the fact that we were surely not alone in the galaxy, our position as observers to a vast interplanetary drama was shattered.  We were welcomed into the fold and grand processions were held in our honor.  The first two civilizations, the ones that had founded this society, treated us as equals rather than cosmic children.  We were overwhelmed to say the least.

&nbsp;

We were brought up to speed on all of the modern technology and scientific discoveries of thousands of years of collaboration.  Our schools of philosophy, arts, and sciences experienced transcendence; our global politics overhauled instantly.  It was a golden age beyond comprehension for our young race.  We were given free roam of the Quadrant stations, the four hubs of civilization that orbited the Core, which afforded all races access to trade, education, and social interaction.

&nbsp;

As the years wore on and we became accustomed to the deluge of information, we settled in quite well.  Our music was cherished as some of most divine noise ever recorded and our talent for diplomatic communication led us to be assigned the role of welcoming committee for each new race discovered. We had matured quickly and soon we found ourselves wanting to earn all that wed been given so freely.  We felt undeserving of such grace in our adolescence, but more than that, we felt wed been robbed in a strange way.  Wed been robbed of the opportunity to uncover mysteries for ourselves.  We no longer had to chase questions.

&nbsp;

Not content with the status quo, we searched for meaning in this galactic paradise.  We yearned to be lured by the sirens of mystery the way we had during our industrial revolution.  We had barely torn the veil from the backwaters of our planet; just scratched the surface of our pioneering spirit when we had suddenly been given the object of our ultimate desires: unlimited information.

&nbsp;

What then remained to be discovered?  Was there no place for the savage explorer?  The Elders, sensing our restless discontent, tasked us with an interest long held by the council but never pursued.  Since we had been graced by fate with the gift of communication, we would be in charge of the Peripheral Searches.  With this first foray into the outer reaches of the galaxy, the council announced that it was no longer satisfied with waiting idly for civilizations to find their way to the Core.

&nbsp;

We had multilateral support from the major three manufacturing civilizations: Rhin, Dejd, and Pitho.  In the first decade we launched and brought online the network of relays; over twenty thousand unmanned stations casting a broad net over the outer third of the galaxy.  We strained our collective ear for nearly a generation.  When our search proved fruitless, the trio combined their R&D to create gravitational pulse generators.  Surely that would have further reaching effect to lure in the curious.  What a foolish venture.  We summoned something from the abyss that we could never fully understand.

&nbsp;

Those of us from deathworlds had long forgotten the lessons of our ancestors:  The fire of civilization burns not only to warm the weary, but to keep predators at bay.  Lurking on the periphery, where night-shadows dance, the chilled air is a sobering reminder of Deaths enduring patience.

&nbsp;

We assumed that theyd come from an outer arm in Quadrant 2 as thats the first quadrant that was attacked but wed no way to prove that hypothesis.  Haati had fallen in an instant. One of the elder civilizations, every soul on the planet had disappeared without a trace.  There were no debris fields of devastated armadas; no blood-soaked battlegrounds.  Cities remained unscathed and ships remained moored at port.  A gentle breeze blew past their capital grounds and only the sound of unfazed critters going about their habits filled the otherwise still mausoleum.  The whole planet was at once both a monument to a great race and testimony to the wicked power at our doorstep.

&nbsp;

We grieved for almost a year before the pragmatic among us began constructing ways to discern the fate of Haati.  None had dared to venture into the Haati system since; not for superstition, but we hadnt since figured out quite what had happened and we didnt wish to chance the unknown.  Some jumped to conclusions, some pleaded to leave well enough alone, but we all knew that the only answer lay within that tomb. It was three standard years before we heard deaths whisper again.

&nbsp;

When Pitho fell, the Council of Military Reserves convened within 5 standard days at Quadrant Station 4, opposite the Core from Station 2.  Military maneuvers within the Core territories had long been exercises against potential unfriendly civilizations, but all members of the Core Alliance were required to pledge allegiance to the Reserves.  Scientists and military advisors debated the merits of showing armed forces in the Pitho system versus instrument reconnaissance.  Ultimately, it was the suggestion of one of our linguists, a Veldian named Tif, which brought sanity to the discussions.

&nbsp;

While generals and scientists argued, Tif, who had been standing against the wall, quietly suggested a unique  approach.

&nbsp;

What about Haati? he suggested meekly and the din of the room fell silent.  All of those seated at the round table turned to look at him.

&nbsp;

I beg your pardon? asked Admiral Bidor, one of the few remaining Haati in all of Core territory and a prominent military advisor.  Tifs body temperature began to rise as he felt the eyes of the room upon him.  He cleared his throat.

&nbsp;

I, um I apologize for interrupting, he paused before beginning again.  I was merely suggesting that, in order to better understand this tragic phenomenon, we might send an expedition to Haati.  Tif felt Admiral Bidors eyes burning holes into him.

&nbsp;

And who might you be? asked the Admiral, his feathers tufting in a display of aggression. Tif fidgeted nervously.  He knew he should have kept his mouth shut.  He knew Zin was going to chastise him for speaking out of turn, but just as Tif began to speak, she entered the conversation.

&nbsp;

This is Tif Vanseen, Admiral.  Hes one of the best linguists in the Alliance.  He spends much of his time in the outer territories as a lead member of the Peripheral Searches, so he may have forgotten some of his manners. Zin shot Tif a cold look.  We sincerely apologize for any offense.  The Admiral seemed to soften, but only a bit.  Of course his immediate reaction might be one of indignation; the mentioning of his home and his people would surely bring up strong emotions.  The Admiral waved the elder female Veldian off.

&nbsp;

Explain yourself, Mr. Vanseen, prompted Bidor.

&nbsp;

Well, Admiral, the only way to combat this threat to the Alliance is to gain intelligence on the source of the calamity. The Admiral raised a sardonic brow.  We know it can't be Pelecrus, but is it a weapon? If it is, what is the nature?  I think that if we have any chance of understanding what is happening, we have to put people on the ground at Haati.  Space based instrumentation can only pick up so much.  Why arent we being hailed from these planets?  Why no call for help?  Why no demands from the aggressor?  It just doesnt make sense.  There has to be some kind of evidence on the surface that weve missed in all of our scans.  Tif felt like he was rambling, but the room remained silent as attention shifted between the two.  Their eyes remained locked as Bidor attempted to peer into Tifs soul.  Without breaking the stare, the Admiral addressed the entire room.

&nbsp;

Prepare our armada.  Send out a call for scientific researchers from every academic institution and the top 100 private firms.  This is a matter of paramount import to the Core Alliance.  We depart from here for Haati in two standard days and no stone will be left unturned.
