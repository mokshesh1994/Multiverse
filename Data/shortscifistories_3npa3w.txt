The End
StevenCarlton
The end of the world was broadcast on television.  Every single human being on the planet with access to a TV tuned in for the event.  Although, perhaps, not very many suspected that was what they were seeing.  It was the most momentous event in human history, said some.  Those who were not religious, at least.  The day that aliens landed on Earth.

They had announced their coming long before telescopes detected the first glint of sunlight on the hull of their massive spaceship.  In forty languages, the same message repeated.  We are peaceful.  We mean you no harm.  Which, naturally, everyone took to mean that they did, indeed, mean great harm to humanity.   

The ship was large but featureless, with no visible weapons.  But what would alien weapons look like, anyway?  It descended from the sky and came to a rest hovering over the center of the Atlantic Ocean.  For whatever reason, they sent only a single landing craft from there to touch down in Kenya, near the birthplace of the human species, where it was met by a single news crew there to film a documentary.  Satellite linkups were quickly established, and every television on the planet flickered to life on the image of a dusty savannah, a silver ship, a group of five dark-skinned tribesmen, and the three alien visitors.  The moment doom was levied on the world was missed by most.  It was easy to overlook.  The alien, there in the back, the one on the left.  The dust rose around it.  

And it sneezed.

So simple a thing.  The aliens, so advanced in their technology and science, had grown far beyond the need to concern themselves with little things like germs.  But life is adaptable.  It finds a way.  The virus, so long denied a fertile breeding ground, found its way into a human lung.  A year later, the only thing that moved upon the face of the world were the shadows of clouds.  Doom had not come from the fist of Nature or the hand of God nor the machines of Man.  

It had come from Peace.
