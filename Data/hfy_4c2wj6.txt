The Most Impressive Planet: Knife of Butterflies
Voltstagge
I said I would get this done on the 24th, but I decided it would be better to delay it a bit. One year and a day ago, I started this series. Many thousands of words later, here we are. There is still much to do. If this you have never read this series before, I tried to make this chapter new reader friendly while also trying out some new things. Here is a big chapter for you guys!

###The Most Impressive Planet: Knife of Butterflies     

----
If you are reading this and you dont know what it means, then you have amnesia. I dont know what is missing from your memories, so Ill give you the short and sweet version assuming you know nothing. You are (we are) Adriel, an agent of the Black Room. You specialized on human genetic engineering and modifications, and you worked with two other agents: Cassiel and Barachiel. You worked in the subterranean labs of Krubera, a vast underground fortress for one of humanitys technologically augmented armies. I will not lie to you and say our research was ethical. There was a line no one should have crossed, and we crossed it. At that point, we all decided that since we were already damned to hell, we might as well keep going and see where we ended up. Besides, fuck that line. It was just holding us back.

&nbsp;

Things were going well until the *Torchlight One* crew fell into your lap. The *Torchlight* crew said they had found a habitable planet that could be the new home for billions of humans, but it was populated with primitive indigenous life.  So they killed all the aliens with an ad-hoc bomb, passed it off as a natural disaster, and claimed the world had always been uninhabited. Obviously, if anyone else found out it would be bad, so you agreed to protect them and keep the truth hidden. The planet was too valuable to us, to humanity, to give up. 

&nbsp;

You can get most of rest of the story from the news. It has been everywhere. You screwed up, and the truth was revealed. What the tabloids wont tell you is that in a last-ditch effort to keep that secret, you contacted TSIG. They are like the Black Room, but they focus more of Earth centric affairs (rather than our focus on offworld colonies), and are completely independent of any human government. You begged two of their leaders, Zhou and Otric, for help. In exchange, you gave them a virus Psychopomp designed. Psychopomp is why you are alive right now, and most likely why you have amnesia. 

&nbsp;

When he found out that you had contacted TSIG and given up his research, he was angry. Your failure to keep Terra Nova buried did nothing to calm him. Psychopomp contacted the Black Rooms executioners, Kushiel and Azrael, and they killed you. Then Psychopomp brought you back to life, like he had done for you and every other member of the Black Room a hundred times before, and killed you again. By my last count, you were executed over 200 times. 

&nbsp;

That was your punishment for failure. You have been pardoned, but your memory has been cloudy, since then. It was not unexpected, and Psychopomp has been treating you for it. It has been helping, but I wanted to be cautious, so I wrote this for us. More concerning than amnesia, has been the visions. 

&nbsp;

Dying that many times in such a short period of times must have done something unexpected to our brain chemistry, as if connecting our mind directly to the Ether wasnt enough of an issue. The flashes have been occurring at random intervals during your waking hours. The rate of visions has increased significantly since you have arrived on Mnn Consela, the capitol of the galaxy. The subject varies, but not the accuracy. 

&nbsp;

Call it predictions, prophecy, or even time travel. I dont know what the cause of it is, but when I see events in the future, they have always come true. The ones that have already come to pass, that is. Visions that appeared to occur in the past are likewise verifiable. Naturally, this is somewhat concerning. If at any point you experience a vision, you must record it in this journal. Do not use a digital recording, it can be hacked. With any luck, my memories will return and I can take over for you. Keep us safe. 

&nbsp;

----     
Ive got the reporter. Cassiel said, his unspoken words transmitted to the rest of the team via a chip embedded in his throat. The device had been designed by Jibrail many years ago in a failed effort to create direct person-to-person telepathy, and allowed communication without spoken words, which had since proven its worth a thousand times over.  

&nbsp;

Let me go! Leanus shouts, slamming her fists into the side of the human who didnt care to notice. The Poruthian was far too weak to pose a threat to you by herself. But then again, that was true of every alien species. 

&nbsp;

Shes not cooperating. Bring the shuttle around. 

&nbsp;

Coming. Get to the roof. Barachiel responded, his voice crisp and clear. I have the *Torchlight* crew. Any sign of TSIG?

&nbsp;

None. Cassiel lifted Leanus onto his shoulder, carrying her like a sack of potatoes as he stepped over the bodies of her unconscious guards. The reporter continued to struggle, whacking Cassiels chest with her knees. It tickled somewhat.

&nbsp;

Someone help! Leanus shouted. Please! He going to kill me! 

&nbsp;

No Im not! Cassiel said, aloud this time, as he carried her to the elevator. I just told you, Im trying to save your life!

&nbsp;

Why would you want to save me? Leanus said as she tried kneeing Cassiel in his shoulder. 

&nbsp;

Hey, put her down! Cassiel turned, careful not to hit Leanuss head on the wall to see a Welet standing outside one of the other hotel rooms. The gangly three limbed sentient looked far too confident for its own good. 

&nbsp;

Or what? Cassiel asked as he pressed the up button. 

&nbsp;

Ill, uh, call the police! the Welet shouted. 

&nbsp;

Yes! Call the police right now! Leanus called. 

&nbsp;

What she said. Cassiel replied, stabbing his finger at the elevator call button. Let them know an evil Black Room agent is kidnapping the crew of the *Torchlight.* You had better hurry up before this human decides to do something *evil.* 

&nbsp;

The small alien wasted no time scampering to lock itself in its room, leaving Cassiel to wait for the elevator. By the time it arrived he could hear the Welets high pitched voice chattering nervously through the closed door. How is Adriel? he asked nonverbally, pressing the button for the top floor.

&nbsp;

There was a moment before Barachiel responded. Lucid. Hasnt had an episode yet today.

&nbsp;

Good. If he insists on us killing as few people as possible we will need his help. Cassiel said as the elevator climbed upwards to the top of the skyrise. And the surviving *Torchlight* crew?

&nbsp;

Less than pleased at being tied up. Barachiel said. But unhurt. 

&nbsp;

How can you be here? Leanus asked, halting her pointless assault. I saw you die on Europa. People dont come back from the dead. Are you a replacement? Is it a mask?

&nbsp;

*Most* people dont come back from the dead. Cassiel corrected her.

&nbsp;

Leanus chitinous face drained of color. Youre not human, are you? 

&nbsp;

I havent gotten sick in decades, my bones are tougher than steel while my eyes can see into the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. I crush boulders with my hands, and I can breathe underwater. Death is a momentary inconvenience. No Leanus, I am not human anymore, but I am close enough that the Council decided to screw over my old species because of your lies. The elevator slowed to a halt just as Cassiel finished.

&nbsp;

The upper levels of most buildings on Mnn Consela were sound proofed to block the noise of the planets notoriously unpredictable and stormy weather, but even so Cassiel could hear the thrum of the shuttles engines. 

&nbsp;

The door to the roof was at the top of a small, isolated stair well, with its digital security latch unlocked. Just like Cassiel was promised by the cleaning staff. The door felt far heavier than it was, as the wind fought to keep it closed. Even with the almost gale-force winds, it could not even slow Cassiels augmented biology. 

&nbsp;

The roar of engines greeted the human and his alien prisoner as a sleek grey gunship hovered several metres from the edge of the roof. Four engines, two in the front and two in the back, fought to keep the heavy vessel steady. It was a Diamonhead, one of the premier personal carriers from CSE Productions. As soon as Cassiel stepped onto the metal grates of the roof one of the panels of the gunship to reveal Adriel, tethered to the gunship by a safety cord. 

&nbsp;

Like Cassiel, Adriel was wearing a full body shimmer suit, designed to obscure the wearers location by reflecting and scattering light around them while the mimetic armor plates shifted colours to reflect the surroundings. Barachiel had spent many months studying cuttlefish in order to replicate their camouflage properties in this armor. Personally, Cassiel did not like it too much, preferring simple black tactical gear with light armor and simple muscle enhancers. 

&nbsp;

Get ready to catch! Cassiel yelled, his voice almost lost in the cacophony of noise.  

&nbsp;

What are you doing? Leanus panicked, trying to wiggle free. Wait, no no no no!

&nbsp;

With a heave, the Poruthian reporter was tossed the half dozen metres to the gunship, screaming all the way. Cassiels aim was true, and the alien slammed right into Adriels chest, the other agent grabbing her quickly to stop her from falling.

&nbsp;

With a running leap, Cassiel soon followed. He didnt look down as he crossed the edge of the roof. It was an uncomfortably long drop. The wind almost threatened to send him splattering across the pavement hundreds and hundreds of metres below, but it was a mere split second of uncertainty before Cassiel landed in the gunship, momentum carrying him into the closed panel on the other side of the ship. 

&nbsp;

Unnecessary. Adriel said, still holding onto Leanus, as Cassiel untangled himself out of the webbing on the inside of the gunship where they stored their gear. 

&nbsp;

I did not want to wait. Cassiel replied. If the Welet had managed to get through, then time was not on their side. Were secure. Take us away Barachiel.

&nbsp;

The gunship pulled away from the large apartment building, Cassiel sliding the side door closed. 

&nbsp;

You wont get away with this. Leanus hissed. The whole galaxy is hunting for your kind, there is nowhere you ca-

&nbsp;

Her words were cut short as the side of the building detonated, a massive fireball blooming like a flower as glass, shrapnel, and steel rained down to the streets below. 

&nbsp;

That is what we are trying to save you from Leanus! Cassiel shouted over the engines. You and the *Torchlight* crew claimed that Terra Nova was the Black Rooms fault! Now TSIG wants that truth buried, permanently! Like I said, the Black Room is now the only thing keeping you alive! 

&nbsp;

----   

I dont know what will trigger the recall of your memories, so I am just writing down every vision I have in the hopes that something sparks a connection in your brain and lets me back in. 

&nbsp;

You are in a surgical theatre. It looks like your lab in Krubera, but it is newer, cleaner, higher tech. The light level is about the same, not that you would need light with your eyes. They were designed to see in every condition. There are several humans here. Two of them are standing at the edge of the room, their faces and forms indistinct. Cassiel is there as well, watching them. The farther away from you something is, the more difficult it is to see. 

&nbsp;

In front of you is a surgical table, and on it an Oualan, its fur stained a dark red with blood. Its body is mangled, with one arm missing just below the shoulder, a lung collapsed, legs broken, ribs shattered, and countless shrapnel wounds, yet it still lives. This fact is conveinient to you, but I cant tell you why. I understand this as much as you do, I am just relaying the message, the feelings and words and sights we saw. 

&nbsp;

Will you be able to do it? One of the hazy figures asked. 

&nbsp;

*He will,* another voice responds. Turning to look, you see Psychopomp standing beside you, a green surgery smock covering his burly frame. *Adriel is an expert in this.* 

&nbsp;

Success is not in doubt. The words feel alien in your mouth, like visitors from a strange land, but they are your own words. Even in the vision, I know we are not being wholly truthful. It is a habit. 

&nbsp;

If you fail the other ghost begins. The threat does not need to be said. 

&nbsp;

*The Black Room has spent centuries playing God, and we have become exceptionally good at it. This will be childs play.* Psychopomp says. 

&nbsp;

*There are always the backup options.* He adds after a moment.

&nbsp;
 
Whatever they are talking about is not made clear. The words are understandable, but the meaning is not. 

&nbsp;

Backup options? one of the ghosts says. The voice is so twisted you can barely make out anything but the words. Tone, cadence, pitch, even the gender of the speaker is lost to the grey static. That will not happen.

&nbsp;

Then lets start. You say with confidence. Time is wasting. 

&nbsp;

Was that tray of instruments always by your hand? Did all those vital monitors exist before now? Or did they just manifest in the vision? I dont know, I cant tell you. 

&nbsp;

*Recording has started. All Black Room associates not conducting the operation are requested to exit.* Pyshcopomp says, placing a camera on a hook above us as the figures beging to waver and vanish, along with Cassiel. *Lead surgeon designated Adriel. Assistant surgeon designated Psychopomp. Purpose of recording: analysis of Oualan species bodies reaction to traumatic events. Analysis of radiation poisoning on Oualan. Threshold at which an Oualan can recover from traumatic events. I will follow your lead Adriel, tell me what to do.* 

&nbsp;

We begin our experiment, and the vision fades just as you reach out. Remember this. 

&nbsp;

----   

15 minutes until we can reach the orbital passage. Barachiel says from the cockpit as he pushes the Diamondhead gunship ever faster. 

&nbsp;

Why not just enter orbit now? Cassiel asks from behind me. 

&nbsp;

Because the orbital passages are the only way to leave Mnn Conselas atmosphere without getting shot down by automated defenses. Barachiel replies. It was true, the thin slices of safe space surrounding the planets many orbital elevators were the only places where exiting the atmosphere was not an instant death warrant. 

&nbsp;

Sirens began to blare as red lights flashed in the passenger compartment signalling incoming hostiles. In the back, Leanus and the two *Torchlight* crew members looked around in panic, straining against the bindings holding them to the bench. Captain Hallant looked far more concerned than Yusufa. 

&nbsp;

No words needed to be exchanged between the three of us. It was second nature, ingrained into our bones after countless hours practicing in the depths of Krubera. The side doors slid open and a pair of automatic rail cannons descended from the ceiling. I took the left gun while Cassiel took the right in anticipation of the coming attack. 

&nbsp;

Good news, bad news. Barachiel says. Good news: its not TSIG. Bad news: it is a small army of Capitol Defense Forces and at least three frontline military attack craft. 

&nbsp;

So aim for the engine blocks. I say. Save the kill shots for TSIG. 

&nbsp;

Was I suggesting mercy because I loved the aliens? Far from it. I loathed them. The Council was a pathetic, bloated mess of a democracy. They had seen fit to strip humanity of all our authority, mere months after inducting us into their hallowed halls because they believed that our governments might be conspiring with the Black Room based on thin proof. Thanks to their spectacular lack of vision from their marble palace, they had seen fit to deport every human refugee who had fled Earth. Countless billions would die when they were sent back to the radioactive hellhole we called our homeworld. Death is what the aliens deserved, but this is one of the rare situations where restraint was necessary.

&nbsp;

We needed Leanus and the crew alive because they were the only ones who could expose the truth that the Black Room had not destroyed the Terra Nova natives. With that lie cleared, we would have one less thing to deal with while we worked to protect our species. But, when you are trying to prove your innocence of genocide, killing a bunch of cops does not help your case much. 

&nbsp;

Engaging as soon as I get a clear shot. Cassiel replied. 

&nbsp;

The first of the police hover cars and fliers slipped out of concealed lookout points and from between the canyons of the city, their antigravity engines glowing blue as they tried to close the distance. 

&nbsp;

I settled my crosshairs on the nearest flier, a small two man brick of a ship, and allowed the rail cannons to do the math necessary to actually aim the weapon properly to hit it. A simple mental impulse from the sensors in my skull was all that was necessary to spool up the Ether core in the gun and launch a rice-sized slug of ultra-dense metal at several dozen times the speed of sound at the cruiser. The armor on the hood didnt stand a chance, the projectile passing through car like a sword through paper. Sparks flew everywhere and I was pleased to see the pilots automatically ejecting as their former ship tumbled lifelessly through the air. 

&nbsp;

One down. Many to go. I said. 

&nbsp;

Two more shots from Cassiel punctuated my sentence as an antigravity engine exploded in a spray of light, sending its hapless users tumbling in an uncontrollable spin, the vehicle detonating harmlessly seconds after the pilots ejected. The screaming, glowing comet of an incoming missile drew my attention, as one of the larger military gunships made itself known. From the large, organic design, it looked to be a Fenyan Torak Fighter. 

&nbsp;

Incoming. I said. Hold it steady Barachiel. 

&nbsp;

The missile was a small target, maybe three centimetres in diameter, but it packed enough firepower to topple one of the hundreds of skyscrapers surrounding us if it was stuck in the right place. It was a small target. Not an impossible one. The metal grain flew straight and true, slamming into the head of the projectile. The shockwave broke a hundred windows as it detonated harmlessly. My moment of triumph was cut short when I looked closer at the incoming Torak and saw the rest of its weapons complement. 

&nbsp;

Hold on! Barachiel yelled. It was an unnecessary warning.

&nbsp;

Gravity suddenly shifted, and I found myself looking straight down to the distant surface of Mnn Consela as our pilot pulled a hairpin turn to fly between a pair of skyscrapers. The gap between them was so small, I could make out the shocked expressions of the aliens as we passed less than a metres from their faces. Another shockwave turned their expressions of surprise into fear as a missile detonated in the air where we had been mere moments before. 

&nbsp;

Our pursuers are going to cause more damage than we are.  Cassiel replied with annoyance, as he fired off another fusillade at the ships brave enough to follow us through the metal slot canyons of the city. 

&nbsp;

Fine by me. If they actually tried to blame us for it, that was another story entirely. 

&nbsp;

More incoming. Barachiel cut in as we slipped out from the between the buildings. The Torak appeared above the towers, raining fire on us. 

&nbsp;

The digital readout on my helmet told me we still had 11 minutes before we reached the orbital corridor, if it was even still open with the small war approaching it. Every last one of our shots found its mark, missiles detonating mostly harmlessly in midair as their firing caps were triggered prematurely. For every one we destroyed, two more took its place, with four more soon to follow. There were too many for us to stop.

&nbsp;

Barachiel heaved on the stick and our gunship went into a death spiral, spinning in vicious circles as the incoming projectiles passed by just an arms reach from us. In the back, the prisoners were struggling to hold onto both consciousness and their meals as the g-forces reached absurd levels. My body, along with that of every other Black Room agent, was designed not to be troubled by that. The sun rose then set, then rose then set, then rose again as up and down lost all meaning. The air seemed to be made of fire and broken glass as the Capitols security ignored the possibility of collateral damage. It was all so familiar. I know this. I saw this before. 

&nbsp;

I closed my eyes, and tried to remember what I had seen. It had been my first flash, before I understood what they meant. There were the missiles, the passengers, and the spinning. And then we survived it. I mimicked the motions I had made in my dream, letting my hands be guided by my memories. Barachiel and Cassiel were yelling to hold on, but I already knew what they were saying, because this had happened to me before. I fired once. There was the sound of an explosion. I fired again, and another, larger one, followed. 

&nbsp;

Holy shit. Cassiel breathed, as I felt the gunship steady out. Opening my eyes, I saw what he meant. The nearest Torak was spinning wildly, one wing completely sheared off at the hull, the remaining antigravity engines trying and failing to hold the massive predator aloft. 

&nbsp;

I did that? My question was answered when secondary explosions ripped along the hull as the remaining missiles detonated, tearing the attacker to pieces. Was I able to make the shot because I had already seen myself make it? Or was it because I was already going to get lucky regardless of whether or not I saw the event? The thought were quickly banished to the back of my mind. There were plenty of times to worry about free will and the middle of a firefight was not one of them. 

&nbsp;

So much for no killing. Cassiel remarked. 

&nbsp;

There had better be some of that luck left over Adriel, Barachiel said. Because we got a problem.

&nbsp;

Two more of the Toraks had shot from the twisting maze of the capitol city, followed by a fleet of smaller craft. Like a swarm of locusts, the security forces were closing in on the last bit of food in the field. 

&nbsp;

Disregarding safety and going punching straight ahead, it would take us nine more minutes to reach the orbital passage, came Barachiels voice again. 

&nbsp;

Too slow. Too damn slow. Why the hell didnt you knock out that alien in the apartment building? We wouldnt be in this mess if you did! I shouted at Cassiel as I zeroed in my sights at the clearest target, a three man interceptor. 

&nbsp;

 Just wait! It should be coming soon! Cassiel yelled back. 

&nbsp;

Wait for what?!

&nbsp;

The sonic boom heralding the newcomers arrival made the Toraks missiles sound like toy firecrackers. Smaller vessels tumbled like leaves in a hurricane as the unmistakable battle axe-shaped silhouette of a TSIG Warpath Air Superiority Fighter violently manifested within the crowd of pursuers, the force of its brutal turbulence an attack all on its own. All other sounds were drowned out as the Warpath proceeded to live up to its name. 

&nbsp;

Air-to-air guns spun up and fired, glowing trails of bullets cutting through the security forces with admirable ease. One of the remaining Toraks was torn in half as the Warpath slammed into the gunships side, the reinforced prow just as effective as any gun. Half of the small fleet peeled off to try and stop the newcomer while the other half increased their speed and continued their pursuit of us. 

&nbsp;

TSIG! In full view of the galaxy! Get me close to one of those fliers. Cassiel said. Our guns are no good against the Warpaths armor.

&nbsp;

Copy that. Barachiel replied. Was Cassiel honestly thinking what I thought he was thinking? 

&nbsp;

On my side I could see the nearest ship, a four person crowd suppression craft. Fast, but completely out of its depth in a situation like this. A pair of Shinatrens were in the cupola positions, aiming a pair of rifles at us like they actually had a chance of stopping our escape. The force of my shot was enough to knock one of them clear out the car, body spinning down to meet the ground below. Minimal casualties were still alright, I suppose. 

&nbsp;

Countdown: 3, Barachiel said as he pulled ourselves closer to the ship. I held off on shooting the other gunner yet, I didnt want them to pull away. 2. 1. Go.

&nbsp;

In one smooth motion Cassiel unclipped himself from his restraints and ran across our gunship. I leaned to the side to give him room, and he jumped. 

&nbsp;

----    

This is the clearest vision we have ever experienced, yet it makes the least sense. Unlike some other flashes of foresight, you do not appear in this one, instead you are merely a disembodied observer watching the insanity around us. It is beyond understanding. 

&nbsp;

The location is on a planet, you know that much. A great castle has been carved into the face of a mountain, the cyclopean structures shooting out of the grey stone like a spear. Lightning rolls around the peak of the mountain, yet there are no clouds. Instead, the bolts shoot down from some great structure hovering far above the range. It looks like one of the orbital plates from Earth, but there are no tethers and the structure is unfamiliar. If this planet is Earth it is not a location you recognize. The sky is a dark grey orange colour, with dust limiting the view of the rest of the mountain range around them. 

&nbsp;

In the distance, the Singularity hangs in the sky, the burning eye looking down on the proceedings like some eldritch demon. Around it, flashes like fireworks light up the sky. Earthquakes can be felt in the distance. Before the castle is a large flat plateau, where countless thousands, no, millions of humans have gathered.

&nbsp;

The crowd is cheering, crying, praying, and reaching up to the castle as if their salvation can be found in those impenetrable walls. The gate has been sealed, and none can climb the sheer cliff faces to reach the ramparts. A balcony above the great gate, far out of the reach of the assembled masses, plays host to a human, a bald man of East Asian heritage. Zhou does not say anything before he returns into the dark tunnel of the mountain. 

&nbsp;

At the sight of his disappearance, the crowd becomes louder and wilder as they call for someone. And then he appears. You know who this person is, you met him when you were begging on Earth for TSIGs help. Otric. The giant is wearing ornate black armor, trimmed in gold and covered in beautiful detailing of dragons and monsters while a great cape of black scales trails behind him. Otric raises his hands and each of the scales in the cape break off and fly around him like leaves in a hurricane. 

&nbsp;

Standing with one foot on the balcony railing, Otric looks like a primal king addressing his subject. His arms raised to the heavens, Otric stands up on the railing, then steps forward. Impossibly, he does not fall, but he walks forward. You cannot understand how, but Otric is walking on thin air. The crowd goes berserk, hands outstretched, not to the sky, but to the warlord of TSIG. The scales of his cape flutter around him, almost forming a giant pair of wings, before twisting into dozens of new shapes. Your earlier opinion is wrong. Otric did not look like a king. He looked like a god. 

&nbsp;

Otric yells something, and you can see now that his right eye and the surrounding area is covered by metal. A small trickle of blood rolls down his cheek, leaking out from beneath the iron eyepatch. The lightning at the peak intensifies, the sound of the storm drowning out the crowd. The bolts become more and more frequent until it is almost a constant stream of light from the orbiting machine, and then you wake up.

&nbsp;

----  

The Warpath was just under two kilometres behind the gunship and closing. No matter how much power Barachiel rerouted into the engines he could not outpace the incoming attack ship. Thanks to the 360 degrees of vision his mind-linked helmet was giving him, Barachiel could see every angle of the aerial dog fight. Most of the remains of the police squadron were shooting at the Warpath, like flies attacking a charging bull. 

&nbsp;

Come on *Hela*, you can do it. Just a bit faster. Barachiel begged the ship. Speaking to the Diamondhead did not make it go faster, it did not have any intelligent systems. Ahead, the hologram of a glowing cylinder surrounding an orbital elevator through the atmosphere signalled the approaching orbital passage. Five minutes away now. Automated messages suggested that for the moment it was still open. All he had to do was not get killed by the Warpath or any other defenses the Council may have set up. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly nose of the Warpath began to glow an angry orange light. The shape of the ship began to waver as the heat built up around the head of the vessel. Nothing required that large of a heatsink except an-

&nbsp;

Ether weapon! Barachiel shouted, heaving the stick of the gunship to the side.

&nbsp;

A blinding beam of energy, brighter than a hundred suns, shot out from the tip of the Warpath at near lightspeed, with only the early warning of the heat sinks and Barachiels superhuman reflexes saving them. Not even the auto polarization of the helmets cameras could have prepared him for the fury of that weapon. Even missing the side of the gunship by several metres, the thermal shockwave alone was enough to knock them into a roll. The spear of energy slammed into a skyrise, coring through the building like it was not even there. 

&nbsp;

The attack lasted less than a second, but that was more than enough to destroy anything short of a starship equipped with an Ether cage. At times like this Barachiel almost wished he had an Ether weapon of his own, but the heat produced by them as they accessed that mysterious dimension of energy made them impractical in most cases. On the other hand, Barachiel did have an Ether weapon of sorts. He had modified his arms to mimic the abilities of the Zo, a predatory alien species who could naturally access the Ether. At will, he could produce vast amounts of heat, capable of melting steel and setting fire to everything else. Not the most practical modification ever, but it was *so much fun.*

&nbsp;

Shit. Adriel said over the comm lines. I think the prisoners may have gotten some burns. Dont look lethal, but we cant let that gun fire again. Cassiel, what can you do?

&nbsp;

In the commotion, Barachiel had lost track of their third member. With a thought, the helmet locked onto Cassiels location, the commandeered crowd control ship flying high above the Warpath, in the hole of the gunships fire arcs. It was exceptionally rare for more than two Black Room agents to work or be together at once, but the three of them had been partners for decades and at times like this Barachiel was thankful that they were.  

&nbsp;

Almost there, keep them distracted. The post-human scientist-soldier said. Of the three of them, Cassiel was the most focussed on improving the human bodys natural abilities in contrast to Barachiel and Adriel who preferred much more dramatic augmentations. Even the augmentations of the Grave Hound legions were like putty in Cassiels superhuman hands. 

&nbsp;

That will not be a problem. Barachiel replied as the Warpath twisted two of its Gatling guns to focus fire on them. 

&nbsp;

With years of training and the finest augmentations research and money could produce, TSIG soldiers were some of the greatest shots in the galaxy. But all those years and all that money meant nothing to Barachiel. Even in the middle of the day the tracers were visible, flicking past their ship as they flew away into the distance to slam into the mirror-like glass that every building was covered in.

&nbsp;

Ahead in the distance, the glowing digital circle of the orbital corridor surrounding the massive orbital elevator began to blink red as the authorities finally realized what exactly their targets were headed for. Automated messages began to broadcast to every pilot in the air, informing them that they had two minutes before the corridor shut off completely. They wouldnt make it before the tunnel became a death trap of anti-aircraft weapons. 

&nbsp;

Im going up now. Barachiel said, pulling the joystick back and angling the gunship to point straight at the heavens above. Now would be the time, Cassiel.

&nbsp;

Watch and be amazed. He replied. As the Warpath angled upwards to follow the fleeing Black Room agents, the small speck of the crowd suppression craft plunged downwards in a kamikaze dive. Even if the Warpath had seen it coming, the hulking behemoth was too large to maneuver out of the way. Barachiel could just barely make out the black-armored figure of Cassiel leaping from his stolen ride a microsecond before it slammed into the spine of the Warpath.

Another vision where you are just an observer. The details of this one are extremely hazy, but the context clues tell you that it is in the past. An exact date is hard to pin down, but it is several centuries old at the very least. It is not one of my/your memories, perhaps it there was an error in the resurrection process and the memories of another Black Room agent got implanted in our head? 

&nbsp;

Three people are sitting on a bench in a grey fog. With a trio exceptions, everything in this vision is a shade of grey. There is the sound of engines, the hum of traffic and pedestrians going about their lives in a great big hurry. Beneath the heaving, choking breath of the city there is the sound of wind rustling leaves, and birds chirping. You can see none of this, only hear it. The only thing that is not lost in the fog around you is a wooden bench, where those people sit. 

&nbsp;

One was a large, muscled man with a beard like a stereotypical lumberjack, wearing a simple red shirt. The other was a shorter, fatter man with cloudy blue eyes. A burn scarred the blue eyed mans otherwise pleasant face. Both had a drink hidden in a small brown paper bag. The third person, a lean woman wearing a yellow jacket, was staring at the sky like she had fallen asleep and seemed to be mostly ignoring her neighbours. Occasionally a faint ghost of a pedestrian would pass by, and you would be reminded that there is a world beyond this bench. 

&nbsp;

Death concerns me, Blue Eyes says. 

&nbsp;

It shouldnt. Red Shirt responds. Why fear what is inevitable? Everyone dies. Youll just make yourself feel older.

&nbsp;

The act of dying does not frighten me. Blue says. It is the thought of leaving my business undone, and the sadness that I will never see what humanity will accomplish.

&nbsp;

Conservative estimate: we both have at least 40 years of life left in our bodies. Red responds, taking a sip from his bag. In those 40 years, we are likely going to see the Launch House completed, the first permanent moon base, and the first successful designer child reach adulthood. 40 years ago, space elevators were fiction, the moon was only the subject of an occasional manned visit every decade or so, and the notion of engineering a human was deemed absurd and foolhardy. That is not even getting in to your own list of achievements. Is that not enough accomplishment for one lifetime?

&nbsp;

You study Blue. He has the look of someone aged by stress. A head that might have once been full of hair was now balding, while his was skin stretched, his eye bloodshot, and if the cane leaning against the bench was anything to go by, he likely had issues walking. 

&nbsp;

No. Blue responds, drinking. Think of the next 80 years: multiple tethers, people living their lives in orbit, perhaps even a colony on Mars or further. Does that not excite you? The thought of missing the wonders to come It hurts me.

&nbsp;

You look back at Red, and that was when you began to have doubts of the vision. Maybe this a corrupted memory? Where Red had once sat, a woman wearing a pair of red sunglasses sat instead. A knife of a person, she was lean and tall, and wore a precise suit more suited for an office than a park. You look back at Blue and see he too has changed. The burn is gone, replaced by an eyepatch covering up his left eye. He had hair again, but a cruel scar cut across the top of his skull like a map to a buried treasure. Yellow is still the same, still half sleeping at the end of the bench.

&nbsp;

It is not that exciting, to be truthful. Not-Red says. She does not have a bottle, like Red did. Death will have come by then.

&nbsp;

Is there is even an ounce of curiosity in your body? Not-Blue says. Do you have even the slightest desire to see what the future may hold? Just think of what we could do with an extra 80 years. With our knowledge we could save so many people! Are you not even entertaining that thought?

&nbsp;

Yes, there is an ounce of curiosity somewhere in here. But curiosity does not have a good reputation when it comes to cheating death. So we shall focus on the now. You can look to the future.

&nbsp;

I shall. Not-Blue says. There is a doctor doing research in the Swiss Alps who thinks he may have found a way to extend a persons lifespan. He needs test subjects. Are you interested?

&nbsp;

Now that, that is interesting. Not-Red says. 

&nbsp;

Yes, Yellow says, finally speaking up. That is interesting. Count me in. 

&nbsp;

The vision collapses around you, until there is nothing left but the grey fog and the rustling of leaves.

Amina DeWolfe was having a bad day. First, the Black Room agents had managed to scoop up each and every last one of her targets before the bombs went off. Second, the Black Room proceeded to get themselves involved in a massive police chase across the capitol city, which could end up with the agents in custody, an outcome that was to be eagerly avoided. Thirdly, in an attempt to do the job personally, Amina now found her Warpath with a gaping hole in the side from shaped explosives. All things considered, it was not that great of a day. The Black Room agent who had just jumped in through the wound was not about to make it any better. 

&nbsp;

You wrecked my ship. Amina said, drawing her shotgun from her back holster and disconnecting herself from the gun control console, returning weapons to the oversight of the pilot. 

&nbsp;

You tried to wreck mine. The bald post-human said. His armor was sleek and seemed to shimmer in the light as it refracted light and mimicked its surroundings. Unfortunately, it did not hide his face. 

&nbsp;

Aminas helmet quickly scanned through several spectrums, trying to get a clear read on the soldier, but the armor was making it maddeningly difficult to lock onto his body. Auto-targeting was not that useful in close quarters anyway, Amina thought as she disabled it. Heck, it was hardly useful in anything but sniping or the firing range.
