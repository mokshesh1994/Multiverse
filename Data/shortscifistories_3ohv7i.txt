Universal Codes of Conduct(UCC):

* Learn and understand the 3 emotions: [NEUTRAL], [GOOD], and [BAD].

* You and I are free to choose any 1 of these emotions in any given situation.

* I, the Creator, will always try to use [NEUTRAL] and [GOOD] before having to use [BAD] in all my decision making.

Phew! I think I can finally be open about everythin...
Oh wait, one more...Problems are [NEUTRAL]...That should do it!

THERE! NOW I think I can finally relax and be open and honest about everything. I can say what I mean and mean what I say, in a sense. Oh hi! If you're reading this, you're probably wondering what's going on or what this guy is talking about. To be honest, I'm not sure how to explain it but I'll try. In a sense, I've become 1 and 0, or 1 and nothing, or 1 and everything, and I mean to prove that in every sense of the way. I'm you and me, and above all, neutral. It's kind of like being Santa, but instead of choosing good and bad children, I'm choosing good and bad thoughts. It's very liberating to think that you have a choice in every matter. When in doubt, go with my UCC and you'll always be fine. Now, sooner or later as I prattle on, you're gonna start to feel very good about yourself and that's ok! Just go back to my 3 "Laws" and you'll figure it out. I'm not lying, I mean, I can if I want to, but I'd only do that out of necessity. I believe with these basic laws we can solve almost every problem in our world and I mean it because I stated that earlier. I aim to transcend humanity and I believe I found the hope in Pandora's box that can get us there. I had a very profound feeling a short time ago that was quite wonderful, and the best word to describe it would probably be enlightened, but I'm not sure yet. I was having a very difficult time trying to grasp the explanation for that feeling. Now I think I know how. And I believe I can get you to experience that same enlightened feeling too. But you have to do one thing for me. It might be tough at times, so I decided to treat it like a game, but like any game, we have to face our adversaries head on. So during those tough times, good or bad, promise me that you'll think back to the UCC for guidance, and you'll always be fine. Now, it's time for you to start your own adventure to find tranquility, if you so choose to ;D, so Good luck!

To start your game, just follow the UCC that I've provided in your every day life decisions and see if it makes a difference in how you feel in your day-to-day interactions. I believe you'll start to feel better every day. To quit, just simply not follows the rules. Easy, right? I'll just see what happens, but it might be hard to not play because in order to not play, you have to understand how to play, and in doing so, you'll be playing the game! You may be feeling like we're going around in an endless loop at some point but that's ok! You're probably going to feel, anger, serenity, or joy or any other emotion quite strongly from time to time too! Just go back to my UCC and you'll naturally go back to a neutral setting. As you do this more and more, you'll start to get a general idea of what good and bad emotions are, but more importantly, the often neglected neutral emotion that you'll need to sort these emotions. This should be enough proof to show that a neutral setting exists. Once you realize this, you'll start to see how useful [NEUTRAL] is. Then you should start to see neutral as a third emotional option in almost every situation. Try it out! Think of any situation, real or imagined, past, present, or future, where the UCC wouldn't work. As you solve more issues using the UCC you'll eventually feel like you're swelling up with emotions(results will vary from person to person on how full you feel) until you reach a point where, like a pop! [NEUTRAL] just makes sense! And like a hole in a dam, your memories should come flooding out making you feel better and better as you sort these feelings out! Then, something a little spooky might happen, I'm sure you'll be able handle it but I still feel I should warn you. The spooky part is, you might get to the point where you realize everything I've written is absolutely true! That's about it for now. If you need more guidance or info, I'll do my best to answer them whenever I can.
