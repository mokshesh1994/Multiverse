Memories

"Just tell me what you see."

"Ok. Well I see you. We're in a small room. Looks like a work lab. You're on a computer... Um... you're typing something. Sorry. I'm just having a hard time concentrating."

"That's okay. Tell me what you remember about the crash."

"Oh wow, the crash. Well I was driving home from work, just taking the usual route. Then I just remember this huge slam from the side. I don't think I got a great look at the other car. Time kind of slowed down, which I thought only happened in movies honestly, and I just remember watching my windshield crack."

"And then what happened?"

"I don't remember. It's all black after that. What are you typing?"

"That's not important. Who am I?"

"What?"

"Who am I to you? What do you know about me?"

"Oh. You're the technician, right? Um... Benjamin."

"Good. How long have we known each other?"

"I don't know. Five years?"

"And when was the crash?"

"This morning."

"That's incorrect."

"What are you talking about?"

"What's your name?"

"Seriously Ben?"

"Please just answer the question."

"Jeremy Gardens."

"Right. And you were in a car accident. Seven years ago."

"What? Seven years? Oh God, have I been in a coma?"

"No. You died. Do you understand?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Why do you think the crash happened this morning?"

"That's just what I remember. What do you mean I died?"

"And how do you know it was you in that car?"

"Because I remember it, Ben! I remember every fucking detail."

"How do you know it really happened? How do you know you're not just making it up?

"It was real."

"No. You only *remember* it being real. You only *remember* experiencing it. But you never actually did. Do you understand? Provide me with one shred of proof that you actually experienced the crash."

"No. It was real. I don't know why you're saying these things Ben."

"Turn around. See that man laying on the table behind you? That's the real Jeremy Gardens. He died in a car accident seven years ago."

"This isn't funny. That man looks exactly like me."

"That's Jeremy Gardens. You're not. You are an artificial neural computing device that is capable of processing human memories. I've implanted you with the memories and experiences of Jeremy Gardens. But you're nobody. You're just a computer."

"But... that doesn't make sense. I'm real! I'm 27 years old for God's sake! Listen to me, Ben. I played hockey until I was 13 when I broke my arm. I used to collect snow globes until my mom threw them all out. I'm a real person! This isn't funny. Who is that really on the table?"

"You said we've known each other five years. I planted that memory inside you. Do you understand? We met this morning. This computer I'm on can alter your memories. Now. How long have we known each other?"

"Thirteen years, Ben. Stop asking me stupid questions and tell me what's going on."

"Just one second. How long have we known each other?"

"It's been about two weeks now, right?"

"That's right. Are you comfortable?"

"Yes, just a little woozy. When is the examination going to start?"

"In just a few moments, I'm just going to run you through a few preliminary questions while my assistant sets up behind you. May I have your full legal name?"

"Gregory Wiesmann."

"And what's the last thing you remember, Greg?"

"Well the accident, obviously. That's why I'm here, isn't it?"

"Yes, of course. Please describe it to me in detail."
