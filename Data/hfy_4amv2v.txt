[OC] At Our Worst
Noaesh
They arrived on a Monday; a solitary ship, surprisingly clunky and ugly despite our most sleek and beautiful science-fiction fantasies, orbiting around the moon herself with such a bright incandescent hue to its hull that humanity couldnt possibly ignore the new colour to their silvery neighbour. 

It took only a minute for the vessel to be spotted; even less for astronauts to peer out their windows and suddenly feel as if the universe was both suddenly too small and far more vast than their dreams had ever allowed. 


It took even less for the rest of the world to notice and crowd together in the dark besides the soft glow of their phones and laptops, their telescopes and awe marking an entirely new page for history to explore. 


We looked hopefully forever upwards at the soft glow of the stars and imagined our most promising stories of galactic peace and prosperity, of benevolence and rapid change, we dreamed of the utopian futures we had created on page but not in life and wondered if this was the point where we finally achieved what our forbearers could not.


Without even transmitting, the vessel had responded of course. Finally, all those calls humanity had dared send into space were answered as the vessel settled into the sea of serenity. Humanity had been collectively yelling, pleading and wishing into the void of the universe, sending all our hopes and reservations out into the great unknown without wondering what would happen if another voice answered. 


We sent Voyagers, and we sent a small token of our small distant world; the sound of our laughter, the pictures of our kindness, our thoughts and feelings, our sciences and music. We wrote a diary entry of the Human Race, kissed it for luck, and sent it into the universe so that even if we were to perish in our time, another may never share the lonesomeness of Humanity, alone in the universe.


We sent Cosmic Calls, and we sent our words, our videos, our sounds and pictures of humanity from every corner of the earth. We sent our languages and our numbers and our mathematical achievements and we hoped to find our peers, to find greater teachers, or even to find willing students.


We sent broadcast messages, and we sent our trust; the very building blocks of our being in the form of the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, and the curves of our double helix. We sent our population numbers and faith; we spoke of our quiet gentle solar system, the place of our very creation. We wrote our love of life into what we shared and double-checked the math behind our declarations.


We sent Pioneers, and we sent a map out into the abyss. Humanity had dared to stand upon such a tiny fragile world and say *Hello, we are humanity, and we hope that you are listening. We hope we are not alone. Come and find us.*


We sent a map out into the universe, and we were *found*.
It took three hours for the vessel, as brightly blue as our most dynamic and abundant oceans to respond to our transmissions. Three hours of translating and analysing and staring up at the moon with all our wonder and boundless curiosity for the first message to be sent and understood.


**We heard you calling,** The first message said, **We heard your probes and broadcasts and found your rudimentary maps. We came to find the species who could call out so joyously to the universe, and we came and found your unsent history.**


Humanity faltered and waited with baited breath.


While we waited for more we turned away from the moon and looked at the blood soaked into our beautiful planet while we wondered why we had ever thought it was Mars that shook with crimson rage.


We gazed back over The Atomic Atrocities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Great Famines Stretching from Ireland and Vietnam to the Soviet and China. We gazed at the ruthless genocide in Rwanda, in Nazi Germany, Bangladesh, in Cambodia and in the Ottoman Empire, we looked at Apartheid and war crimes, we looked at the slavery still in our world while we still averted our eyes, and the torture we had sworn and sworn again we would never use.


Humanity found itself glancing over the lists of ruthless extinctions, lists of children we had failed to protect and sickening stories of the monsters humanity had raised within our own while we failed to understand even the past hundred years of our history without our fingers feeling slick with blood and ash. We gazed upon the creation of * crimes against humanity* and * war crimes* and we shuddered under the knowledge of what its foundations were crafted of.


We followed these stories to a billion graves and glanced back up at the moon with far less hope as we waited to meet the disgust of creatures that had come to meet only the best of our deceptive kin. Humanity waited and prepared to scream in horror and terror at ourselves, at the universe.


**Aggressive, dangerous species are best left alone in their corner of the universe,** The second message said, **Weve seen your history, and the universe has never had the honour of meeting such a peaceful, and amicable species. Welcome to the universe, you will never again be alone, friends.**


Humanity exhaled in relief and preened at the moon, minds filled with wonder and delight, dreaming of Enterprises and Millennium Falcons.



We should have *screamed*.
