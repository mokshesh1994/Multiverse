This Morning, When I Woke Up (565 words)

This morning, when I woke up, I suddenly realized that I can remember my future.

How's that, you say? It's just like remembering your past. Like how I remember lying down in bed last night, or how I drank a few cans of Heineken while working through the night prior to that, or how I walked home from the office and passed by 7/11 to grab a six-pack.

The only difference is how I'm seeing my future as if it's already a memory imprinted in my brain. In a few seconds, a bird will hit my window and leave a crack on the glass.

There it is.

Curious -- how much of my future do I actually remember? Thinking about it, I remember that I'll be fired tomorrow. Can't say that's a bad thing because I hate my job. The day after that, I'll be downstairs entertaining my parents. What. They'll stop by during their US tour.

A part of my "future memory" seems hazy though. You know how you think hard but can't seem to remember parts of your dream, if any at all? Yeah... that's what a few weeks from now feel like when I try to remember.

Ha, everything happened just I remember them a few weeks ago. Weird thing is, it doesn't feel predetermined -- though it obviously is. You know that paradox where you can change your future if you know how it will play out, so your earlier knowledge won't apply anymore and thus your foresight would have been wrong? Apparently it doesn't work that way. Things I remember just happen naturally as my day goes by. I don't consciously remember what happens and act accordingly, I just remember *after* they've already taken place that that's how they are in my memory.

So I guess you can say free will is still intact, just that you already have decided in advance and you can remember that.

My memory says that tonight, I will win a few games of DotA and my ex-colleagues would come over for beer and they'd be bringing old UFC dvd's.

*Addendum:* Yep, my memory was spot on. George brought dvd's of Royce Gracie! Imagine that. Shit's old! I can still remember a few days from now, but the days that are blurry from last week are still blurry today. Weird. I thought they'd be clear by now.

Living near the San Andreas fault has a few annoyances, specifically, the tremors every now and then. Their frequency have been growing these past few days, and it's unnerving, to say the least.

Tonight, Carla will text me and ask if she can drop by. I see some sweet lovin' ahead, no joke. Prior to that, I see myself shaving. So I guess my future me sees the future him as well. Makes sense.

I can't remember what'll happen tomorrow though, which is odd.

Was our sex *that* good, or were there strong tremors? Was that a mini-quake?

On a side note, I think I've lost my ability to remember the future. I'll miss it, but it's not like I can't live without it. I've lived almost thirty years without that, so meh. Can't even remember what's gonna happen this afternoon anymore. It's all just static.

*Addendum:* anybody, pl ease help,wer'e trapped
