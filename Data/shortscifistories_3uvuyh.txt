Pocket Universe
buddhistmonk0
We realized our calculations would frequently take longer than the lifetime of the universe (longer than the lifetimes of many universes, in fact) and so the decision was made to allow the computer to create pocket universes in which to perform it's calculations. The computer would spend billions of years floating through these new universes, thinking. And when it was done the pocket universe would be collapsed and the computer would rejoin our own universe with the results, a few seconds after we sent it on it's journey. The only problem we encountered with this technique was how to prevent life from growing inside the pocket universes. The death toll was in the trillions of trillions each time we collapsed one. But that's the cost of progress.
