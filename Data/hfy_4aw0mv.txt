**13y, 8m, 3w**  
Operators Barracks, HMS Sharman, Folctha, Cimbrean

**Daar, Champion and Stud-Prime of Stoneback**

Daar drifted out of sleep on a lazy Saturday morning, the very last such day before the JETS team deployed on their first reconnaissance mission. Tensions were high, needless to say, and Daar in particular was a bouncy, nervous menace before his first combat mission with the Humans.

Still, lazy Saturdays were the **BEST** and Daar would take full advantage before he consigned himself to the high gravity, mud, cold weather, rain, and possible infections of the class-11 world they were heading to.

None of which was on Daars mind at that moment. He and Vandenberg slept in luxuriantly late, waking to the smell of sizzling bacon, warm syrup, eggsDaars eyes snapped open as the glorious scent caressed his nose, tickling his brain in all the right ways. *Bacon!*

Rebar! Cmon, wake up! Daar snuffled at Rebar, who did not respond; unsurprising, since the big man was a very heavy sleeper. No matter, Daar knew just the trick. He gently nosed Vandenberg on the cheek, a thing the Gaoian discovered long ago would instantly awaken the big Human. This was risky, it must be said; Rebars wrath could be legendary. But fortunately for Daar, Vandenberg was already beginning to stir.

Daar could hardly contain himself. He was very much a morning being and *this* morning had bacon, which was the best thing *EVER.* FOOD! BREAKFAST! CMON, GIT UP, GIT TO THE KITCHEN! Vandenberg looked at the massively bouncy Gaoian and puzzled; something in his tone and word choice stirred an old memory. Rebar *swore* hed seen this movie before.

But Rebar, apparently, did not appreciate Daars courteous wake-up assistance. He grumbled and shoved the massive beast off. Mmmpf, fuck, gerrof Tigger! Rebar rubbed at his eyes blearily and roll-fell out of bed, then shambled off to the latrine to relieve himself. Daar pounced out of bed and did the same.

Rebar was a man who took a while to regain full function, like a huge, heaving engine of doom. All the humans seemed that way to Daar, except maybe Murray.

Murray was scary. Perfectly friendly. Kind, even. But *scary.*

Rebar veered towards his shophis usual Saturday morning routinewhen he finally caught scent of the cooking bacon. Fuck. Too early for this shit. I need coffee. And breakfast.

Theyre making pancakes!

Yeah, I can smell it. Cmon, he chuckled, Lets get some before Horse eats it all. They both thumped happily to the kitchen, Daar with his usual bouncy, whirl-around-the-friend motion, and Vandenberg with his plodding, heavy steps. 

Regaari and Warhorse were hard at work in the kitchen while Righteous, fresh from his workout, was already shoveling food into his face, a huge mug of steaming black coffee in hand. And down the hall, Daar could hear the other men stirring, too. The men were, as usual, boisterous, happy, and conversing about important things. Like food.

The Duo walked in right as The Giant was making a point. Firth paused while everyone greeted each other, then waved his coffee cup around dangerously and resumed the conversation. Anyway, like I was tellin you boys, waffles are better, and Horse can back me up, even if he has crap taste in em. Fuckin Eggos man.

HEY. Eggos are *amazing.* Do I need to beat yer ass silly? He waved his spatula in a mock-threatening gesture. Maybe some wrasslin time?

Pff, bring it, beefcube. Ill kick yer ass *all over* the gym! The two men chuckled and returned to their tasks: Ars to his eggs, Firth his bacon and waffles.

I see you two are uncivilized brutes, chittered Regaari with a friendly tone, Who cannot appreciate the *magnificence* of a perfectly cooked, lightly seasoned griddle cake. Layer it in butter and this excellent maple syrup of yours

Daar had to admit that sounded pretty good. He began to drool as he listened. Meanwhile, Vandenberg wobbled his way toward the coffee. How the horribly bitter brew worked, Daar did not know, but its powers seemed almost magical. Within a few sips he knew Rebar would be back to his friendly, bemused self.

Hey, smirked Firth, Aint nothin wrong with pancakes. Sometimes I like somethin sweet an simple. But waffles are just better an you cant convince me otherwise.

Daar snuck over to Horse and begged off some bacon, eggs, and a nice stack of warm pancakes. He headed to the table with his treasures and began applying butter and syrup. And strawberry jam. Pancakes *always* got strawberry jam.

Regaari looked at Daar. He had just begun shoveling pancakes into his face obliviously and was eating with the aggressive determination only the Humans could match. What say you, Cousin? Pancakes are superior, yes?

Daar paused, fork halfway to his mouth. He looked down at his food, then back at Regaari, then back at his food. He whined, very slightly. UmI guess I like waffles more. Nooks and crannies! You can stuff more flavor onto them.

Regaari regarded him with a measured gaze and a half-grin. But pancakes are smooth and fluffy! Nice and easy on the digestion, while waffles are just too uncivilized for any proper Gaoian.

Ha! Since when was I ever proper? He paused and scritched at his left ear with his rear foot-paw. An impressive feat, considering he was seated on the corner of the bench.

Regaaris eye twitched almost imperceptibly.

Daar continued as if he hadnt noticed. Besides, Id rather be uncivilized and live like a Gaoian is meant to live. I mean, you wont even run on all fours less Horse over there makes ya! Also, waffles are tougher. They can take lots more butter, an more butter is better! Daar tilted his head and looked at Ars, Which do you prefer, Warhorse?

Ars turned around and smiled somewhat strangely at Firth. Oh, Im not picky, pancakes or waffles is fine by me. Just, yknow, slong as I get a *lot* of breakfast.

Firth grinned just as strangely. Mhmm. Cant go wrong with all-day breakfast!

The tone wasdifferent. Daar suspected there was a joke at play.

Hell, several times a day! Just bacon and waffles, over and over

See, I knew I liked you for a reason. Firth giggled into his waffles and resumed his ravenous bacon-feeding.

Regaari looked at Daar. He was just as confused.

At that point, Murray padded in like a whisper and joined the conversation. What about crepes?

Firth chuckled darkly. You take that communist surrender-monkey bullshit outta here. *Real* men eat *real* breakfast. He wore what the humans called a shit-eating grin. Quite how the humans came up with such a concept was beyond Daars ken, but the mere thought of it made him chitter deeply. *Maybe that was the point?*

Pff, scoffed Warhorse. Crepes are lame, all thin and flaccid. How could anyone be satisfied by that?

Murray grinned, It's no the crepe that's important, it's what ye do with it.

Baloney! Ain't much you can do with something so...tiny.

Firth snorted into his coffee while Vandenberg pressed the point. "See, this is the problem. You're so used to a bigbreakfastthat you don't see the possibilities. Different, uh, flavors He broke out giggling.

No finesse, agreed Murray with a grin, That's your trouble. Just slam it down, as much and as hard as you can.

Hey, I'm a big boy with big appetites. And I don't hear anyone complain about mybreakfast. He laughed, Also! None of you here are exactly known for their *petite* habits. Well, except Murray there was a good-natured scoff from the Scot, and cat-calls from the other men, But hes not a Murrican so it aint his fault.

Murray retorted with a grin. Better skilled than oversized an overfed. In the meanwhile, Ars had produced an enormous stack for Murray. The Scot looked at the breakfast tower and raised his eyebrow incredulously.

Firth jumped back into the fray. Hey, leave the poor man alone. Hes a growin boy an he needs nice, hearty portions! As much and as often as he can get em, too. Is it any wonder he likes to offer such largeservings?" Again with the enormous grin.

Rebar had a retort at the ready. Oh, sure. Some like it. Others go staggering home holding their belly and saying never again because you stuffed them too full.

Warhorse glared at Rebar in a not-unfriendly manner, who along with Righteous, could barely hold back their laughter.

See, thats the thing, yer doin it wrong, commented Firth between mouthfuls of bacon. A big stack of waffles, yneed as much grease as you can get. Makes it go down easier. He smirked at Regaari and Murray, Sounds like waffles are too challenging for yer delicate mouths to take. Heh.

Horse chuckled over by the stove while Murray smiled and shook his head, knowing better. But Regaari took the bait. My mouth can handle waffles just fine, you great brute. I simply have more refined tastes.

It took considerable restraint on everyones part not to comment. Firth, on the other hand

Gotta make sure you fill *all* the holes with lots of cream, though.

Daar jumped in obliviously. Oh, yeah! Fill every single little square with as much butter as it can take! Then smear jam all over the top! Daar eyed the waffle iron with a growing hunger.

Mmm, grumbled Firth. Kinky.

Adam burst out laughing over by the stove. Daar and Regaari looked at each other in silence, then sighed.

Humans.
