[OC] Forgotten v2.00

On every planet lies a vast, open sky, and beyond that reaches into the endless sea of stars. On every planet housing sentient life, there are philosophies. These philosophies can make or break an entire species' potential. However, despite all pretense, despite all logic, there is a deeper yearning within life. This yearning calls out to what one species would call 'Miracles'.

An empty ship, abandoned since times long forgotten, sits dead in a particularly hazardous region of the galaxy. Many have theorized that it must have been hit by a solar flare from a nearby star, however the evidence to support this theory is quite lacking. While most do not know of this ship's existence, those who do would give anything to explore its ancient hull and plunder through the forgotten technology that must have been inside.

Even though it has been far too long for anything to remain alive and well inside of the ship, it is in remarkably good condition. Pirates have been known to attempt to track this particular ship down upon learning of it. Those relics on the inside might have been worth it, too. As the species of the Planet Earth would say, the region of space that the ship was in was the intergalactic equivalent to their 'Bermuda Triangle'. A place filled with superstitions and nearly as many corpses.

Without a proper name for this region of the stars, there was a chance that captains could wander into that area without meaning to do so, risking their lives for no good reason. An artist on some planet whose name is neigh impossible to properly pronounce called the area, what roughly translates to, Stardew Valley. Named as it was due to the amount of nebula one would be able to see within the sector. It was a real shame, what could have been a popular tourist destination amongst the sea of stars ended up to be nothing less than a horrific dump of failed expeditions.

It was said by a young scholarly type man not too long ago that there was activity in the sector. The Councils chuckled and ignored it, believing it to be some sort of distraction, some sort of trap or display of false hope. They simply did not have the equipment and men to send out into such a dangerous area. This Scholar went to the News with this issue. Presenting it as a potential solution to the problem of not knowing what was out there. Our Scholarly friend went on to research the area before he unfortunately passed away, sixteen years after making his discovery. While his death was being mourned, most forgot about the entire issue at hand with the Valley. There was not one expedition to go out into that region since the Scholar's death.

They really should have listened to him, though.

As that old ship, that ruined, ancient structure of star surfing, has been seen on the move once again.
