The theory is that time is relative. Which is true, considering that the universe spans infinitely in both space and time. The universe came from a big bang, of an infinitely dense particle. And so it shall return to a particle by the end of its infinite life.

Which means, that by virtue of infinity, all possible configurations of electrons, protons, and neutrons, gluons, quarks, and bosons, ups, downs, and charms, and every single particle have already taken place, and we shall all and have been the stars, the moon, Jesus, Pilate, the Pope, and Hitler.

And as I looked deep into her eyes that fateful night under the stars, what I saw scared me.

Infinity hit me like a megaton bomb, shattering my soul, crushing everything that I thought I knew.

In her eyes, I saw me.
