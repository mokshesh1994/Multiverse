Memories
mattpayhan
I often came to with no idea of where I was. I always knew who I was, my name, where I lived, who the president was, all that stuff, but I'd wake up in random places like the beach, and even in a castle once, with absolutely no memory of how I got there. While I do drink on occasion, I don't get blackout drunk, nor do I drink nearly as often as these apparent blackouts occur.

When I try to remember how I got where I am - trying to recall memories of the day before - it's always a blank. It feels like static when I try to think about it, and pushing harder actually physically hurts. So now I just focus on the pattern.

And by the pattern, I mean The Girl.

If she's not there when I wake up, she shows up soon afterward. If she doesn't show up soon, I'll see her pretending to ignore me later. Sometimes she speaks to me like an old friend. Other times, she is entirely distant, and will flee if I try to confront her.

I don't know her name, or what she has to do with my memory loss, but I can tell she knows something. Something she isn't letting on about when she speaks to me like a friend, and I can't shake this feeling I am not where I'm supposed to be....
