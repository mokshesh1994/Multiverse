Temporal Facepalm
frankz0509
My mom was the sweetest person. I say was because she died when I was a teenager, tripped and fell in the kitchen, cracked her head, of all things. She went peacefully, but my life thereafter never was the same.

I glance down at my phone as the notification I was waiting for arrived. The temporal relocation machine is ready, and so am I. I stand up, walk ten paces towards the spherical chamber, open its hatch, get in, and cross my fingers.

I feel a tingling sensation from my toes, up my knees, and into the back of my head. I check the readouts from the in-chamber displays: Destination -- 10 August 1994.

The air is knocked off of my lungs. I gasp for breath. And then here I am, in 5 St. James Drive, 20 years ago. I look around, and instantly recognize the den.

There she is. Tiptoed below a kitchen shelf, reaching for something in the upper drawers. I must warn her! I check the floor for any slippery material. None. But I must move fast.

"Mom!" I say, announcing my presence.

I startle my mom, her tiptoe losing balance as she futilely tries to grasp onto something to avoid falling. But she does anyway.

I leave a blueprint, some dates, and instructions for this-reality's past me, hoping that HE can save mom in some other timeline.

If time were a person, surely by now he'd be facepalming so hard he'd lose his face.
