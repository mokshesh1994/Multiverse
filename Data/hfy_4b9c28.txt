##**Part Eighteen**  

Him again? said Hollywood when he arrived at the hotel and found Zip and George sharing breakfast.  

Hear me out, said Zip.  

The smile rotted and fell away from Hollywoods face. Absolutely not.  

Its Tetriss dad.  

I dont care if hes the Pope. No money, no trip. Simple as that.  

Zip pushed a hand backwards through his hair. 

Alright, he said, I knew this would happen, so Im exercising my nuclear option.  

Hollywood squinted but didnt say anything. He hadnt looked over at Tetriss dad once.  

Take his fee out of my share, said Zip.  

Ha!  

Im serious.  

Youre telling me you want to pay two million dollars to probably get your best friends grieving father killed? Because thats what Im hearing. Shit, Zip, if you want him dead, I know people wholl handle it for four thousand bucks!  

I dont have to explain myself to you. Just promise youll do your best to keep him alive.  

Do you think Im a monster? Im going to do my best to keep all of them alive! But that doesnt mean its going to happen!  

Zip put his fork down, feeling queasy. After a few moments, he turned to George, who had stood up at some point during the conversation to glare, stiff as an ironing board, at Hollywoods disinterested face.  

Come on, said Zip. Sit down.  

But it was no use. The scrambled eggs had lost whatever watery flavor they had to begin with. The breakfast rolls tasted like ash. Zip pushed his plate back with a sigh. He searched the room, but the girl in the yellow sundress was nowhere to be found. Shed probably checked out. Somehow the fact that hed never see her again seemed like the real tragedy in all of this.  

When they pulled up to the training camp, Zip almost laughed at the tents, which were clumped together so close in the middle of the field that some of the innermost trainees were having trouble finding their way out.  

Whos he? demanded one of the trainees, pointing an indignant finger at George.  

He showed up late, said Zip.  

Wheres his tent?  

Zip turned to look at George, whose possessions were limited to a ratty backpack and a green sleeping bag that dangled in its plastic carrying cylinder from his hand.  

Somebodys going to share, said Zip.  

Groans.  

Whoever agrees to let my bud George sleep in their tent gets to skip the first two laps, said Zip.  

Nobody volunteered, although a few trainees groaned and bent, stretching creaking muscles.  

Lets try that again. In five seconds, youre all running laps until somebody volunteers.  

Grudgingly, a large man with thick eyebrows raised a pudgy hand.  

Great. Show him your tent. Let him dump his stuff off.  

Zip watched the two of them tiptoe through the maze of stakes and tent-lines, a strange urge to give a grandiose speech building within him.  

Sixty million generations ago, he began, your ancestors were snot-nosed little rats, sniveling timidly around mountains of dinosaur shit. I will take this moment to note that not much has changed. Those ancestors were defined by fear. Cowardice. I can teach you many skills, fill your brain with knowledge, but if you want to survive, the most important trait to foster is fear. In the forest, if you ever forget your fear, even for a moment, you will be consumed. In the forest, you are prey. You are a cocktail sausage. A couple of you, he paused, scratching his nose, are sticks of beef jerky, or roasted hemispheres of ham. But all of you are food of one kind or another. Is that clear?  

From their faces, he could tell that they wanted to roll their eyes, but were prevented from doing so by the desire to avoid having to run additional laps. 

Well. Hed never paid attention to any of the speeches Rivers gave, either. Although then, at least, hed had the excuse of being a teenager.

The man whod agreed to let George sleep in his tent was coincidently also named George, although everyone called him by his last name, which was Matherson. He owned a chain of dealerships across the country that sold tractors, forklifts, cherry-pickers, and other equipment of similar scale. The name of the chain was Matherson Mid-sized Machinery. George Mathersons net worth was around fourteen million dollars; he was spending two million on this expedition into the forest.  

If his wife, Sherry, had somehow survived the accident five years ago, she never would have let him sign up for this. But a drunk driver had plowed a blue SUV into her Mini Cooper at forty-five miles an hour, and youd have to have been Superman to survive that, which Sherry most definitely wasnt.    

Sherry had always been a skeptic. And bitter, as Matherson recalled, although that didnt pollute his memory of her. He could honestly say that she was the only woman hed ever loved. Although these days when he tried to remember her face all he saw was a pair of smiling eyes on a bright blank oval. In real life she was bitter, and hed always attributed the bitterness to her infertility, which although it hadnt bothered him (he was extremely uncomfortable around children, didnt know how to act or what expressions to make, and always had the feeling that he was scaring them, somehow) had really bummed her out.  

So he didnt have kids, and as of five years ago he didnt have a wife, which meant he was alone. After the grief more or less dissipated, he didnt mind the loneliness too much, since at the end of the day he didnt really like people. People tended to be loud, and selfish, and these days more and more people seemed to be adopting ideas he found repulsive, such as the homosexuality thing, or the abortion thing He packaged those issues up and stashed them in the corner of his brain labeled Concerning But Ultimately Not Worth Worrying About. At least until election season rolled around. When he voted against pro-abortion, pro-gay candidates, it felt amazing, like he was stamping a big red NO on all those awful mental images of purple-headed male genitalia slapping against each other, the ones that always came to mind when he heard the word homosexual.  

Not to say that these were important issues to him, because at the end of the day, you know, he didnt really care. Psh. People were going to do whatever they were going to do. He just wished they would stop shoving his face in it. Gay pride parades! Scantily clad men exchanging saliva in public! And everyone acting like it was okay! Like it was natural!  

It was gross, really, and he didnt want to think about it. The worrying thing was that his candidates kept losing, and sooner or later he figured he was going to have to choose between two presidential candidates who BOTH thought it was okay for men to whack their turgid dongles against each other, and when that happened it would probably sicken him so much that hed retreat from politics entirely, and cancel his cable subscription, and live out the rest of his days on the porch of his ranch house, watching the wind ruffle the trees and drinking a Coors Light or two while his Mexican gardener (the legal kind, of course) drove neat loops around the enormous lawn in a high-end John Deere mower taken direct from the stock of Matherson Midsized Machinery  

At least that had been the plan until the forest business really began to take off. Matherson saw the Green Ranger on television and knew at once that he was staring at the next step in the human evolutionary chain. By the time he turned to the Internet for a spot of research, there were already hundreds of forums obsessing over the forest and the Green Ranger himself. Immortality was the word being bandied about. Rumors said that once you were greenified the forest could fix your injuries, cure your illnesses, keep you alive forever. Some claimed that the transformation allowed you to read minds. Others, more ludicrous still, claimed that it granted you the ability to photosynthesize, so that youd never have to eat again, just go around drinking gallons of clean water all day long.  

He tried to squelch the idea. He threw himself into his business, opened two new dealerships, stayed up late speaking to the managers who ran his existing branches, but there was only so much to do. He always had time left over. He took a vacation, sat around in cafes in Italy trying to look like he was comfortable being in a public place by himself, snapped pictures of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the idiotic tourists pretending to prop it up. The suckers, many of whom he suspected of being homosexuals, although these days you could never tell for sure, had no idea how ridiculous they looked.  

He even gave online dating a try, to no avail. Every woman who expressed interest in him was chubby, ugly, or both. Not that he was the skinniest falcon in the roost. But he had money, right? Wasnt that supposed to translate to the affection of women? Clearly there was a step in the process that he was missing. But he didnt know what it was, and he didnt know who to ask.  

The longer it went, the more the purposeless thumb-twiddling life began to grate on him, and the larger the Green Ranger loomed in his imagination. He read dozens of books about the forest, binge-watched old ranger programs, and hired a personal trainer to help him get in shape. Fifty pounds slipped off him in four months, leaving him a spry two hundred and fifty, practically an Olympic long-jumper, or so he dryly remarked to his fawning employees.  

Once the idea took root, it was impossible to think about anything else. So when Matherson heard about Hollywoods program  run by real rangers!  all the self-control came crumbling down at once.

It should be noted that all the applicants to Hollywoods forest expedition service were like George Matherson in the sense that they were both fabulously rich and hopelessly unhappy. Most of the trainees had spent their lifetimes increasing each factor in equal measure. The richer they got, the more unhappy they became. When an unhappy person throws himself or herself into acquiring wealth, it is in the hope that wealth will beget happiness. As wealth increases, and enjoyment of life somehow fails to improve in equal measure, the perceived likelihood of additional wealth increasing happiness begins to dwindle.  
Once youve tried and failed to achieve happiness through money, theres only one road left to take. And it was this path that the applicants saw themselves taking through the deepest reaches of the forest: the path to immortality.  
Green skin, two million dollars, and the risk of death, the applicants figured, were small prices to pay for everlasting life.
