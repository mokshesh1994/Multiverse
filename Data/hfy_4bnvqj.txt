**The One In Which They Make an Unsettling Discovery**

&nbsp;

Throngs of beings moved out of the central cavern, each group led by one of his own group. After bringing his remaining companions in on the plan, jotting down their tablets unique IDs, and pointing out the weapon caches, theyd wasted no time on enacting the next phase of Kingdom Come: *Arm the Masses*.

&nbsp;

Devoid of coiling lines of creatures the cavern was hauntingly quiet. It reminded Tom of one time when the SFMakerspace had been unusually still. Rarely without at least *someone* else (often multiple someones) running around the space working on a project, the occurrence had been both unsettling and surreal. Hed spent a whole minute, unmoving, gently breathing lest he break the spell.

&nbsp;

Shaking his head, Tom turned towards Twinkle who had Lightfoot curled up on his back.

&nbsp;

*That* was new. Twinkle must have missed the little guy. Go figure, the crabby unicorn could feel something other than agitation and hostility.

&nbsp;

Whats next Tomtomgriffin? Lightfoots voice sounded so small in such a big space. Now that they didnt need to whisper or sneak through trailing lines of hellizens (Lightfoots new term for the citizens of the underworld) their normal voices were dwarfed by the vast space.

&nbsp;

I have no idea. Im kind of making this up as I go, Tom answered honestly. 

&nbsp;

Thats obvious, Twinkle said. Cant you just*make up* the next part?

&nbsp;

Well, Im trying to draw out Satan. Hes not packing much in the way of an army now that I can neutralize his bots. There are a few non-robotics on his side but Im confident they could come to see things our way. Perhaps not Stek. That man wanted to be on the bloody side of a confrontation.

&nbsp;

Tom hadnt spotted him among the masses or any of his cohorts for that matter (had the woman been pulled from the acid pit?) but that didnt mean they hadnt infiltrated the enormous gathering. Itd be nearly impossible to check everyone that passed out of the cavern into the winding hallways.

&nbsp;

For a moment fear gripped his heart. Hed sent his people out there with strangers trailing behind them. If Stek and his cronies had slipped into those linesinto *Evas* line? He resisted the impulse to run after the direction shed gone. Eva could take care of herself, plus she was traveling with the capable Gronak.

&nbsp;

But just to ease his mind he pinged her tablet, making note of their position. Then, for good measure, he checked the others.

&nbsp;

Its a few steps ahead of where wed planned to be, Lightfoot mused, cocking his head in thought. But, thats the rub of it, aint it? Things almost never go according to plan. Like the night my mates and me planned to take the throne room it rained and the tunnels wed dug into the keep grounds were flooded higher than a stoats spine is long!

&nbsp;

Tom laughed at the mental image. What did you do?

&nbsp;

Lightfoots whiskers twitched, We climbed the walls instead. Rain makes its own kind of cover. But when we eventually took the throne, my first act was to have the keep foundation extended by a dozen feet. Didnt want those passage ways to come back against me.

&nbsp;

Smiling, Tom stilled, an idea forming. Raising his tablet he searched the map for the torture rooms. There, down a set of northern tunnels. There were large grey marks through the rooms but Tom translated the label. Scarabs.

&nbsp;

It was only the seed of a plan. Not even a good one. Just something that struck him and he needed to satisfy his curiosity. Something that might *come back against* Satan. Even if nothing came of his idea this was the time to do it, while everyone was arming themselves and readying for the next stage of the operations; whatever that might be, he didnt know. Not yet.

&nbsp;

Lets check something out. Tom made for the tunnels on the map. They were some distance away but without having to push through hellizens would make the going easier.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Even for how uninviting Hell was, the hallways to the scarab torture rooms had a particularly desolate and isolated feeling to them. For one, there was barely any lighting. It was so dim itd forced Tom back into the main cavern in search of a candelabra.

&nbsp;

Wax trailed down the warmed metal, dripping like breadcrumbs back the way theyd come. Its flickering light cast their shadows against the walls, elongating them into slinking distorted monstrosities.

&nbsp;

And then there were the light scratching sounds that seemed to come from everywhere: the walls, the floor beneath them, even the high ceiling. It made Toms skin crawl and he found himself checking his skin more than a dozen times, half expecting to spy a dark shelled bug crawling over him.

&nbsp;

What in the name of Hades are we doing here? Twinkle asked. There was a hint of nervous unease to his tone, though he did his best to hide it behind annoyance.

&nbsp;

These rooms were marked through with a grey X. I think that means they were deemed off limits or closed. The scarab rooms. Tom swung a glance over his shoulder to Twinkle.

&nbsp;

The scarabyou cant be serious! We dont even know if that story had any truth. It was likely hundred, if not thousands, of years ago. Twinkle huffed, stopping in his tracks.

&nbsp;

Tom turned to face him. But, if there is some truth to it, they might be the only ones whove seen and interacted with Satan. Not to mention the idea of leaving them bricked into a pit with flesh-eating scarabs didnt sit right with him. 

&nbsp;

When Twinkle stayed stubbornly in place Tom added, Ill admit, the chance is small, but there could be valuable intel waiting for us. What does it hurt to check it out? Ive got a handle on the bots and everyone else is busy.

&nbsp;

Whatever is down in those pitsit wont be in possession of its faculties. Whatever shred of sanity they had when they came here was likely shred to tatters after sufferingthat fate. Twinkle visibly gulped.

&nbsp;

All the more reason to liberate them. Tom turned back and moved deeper. After a moment Tom heard the clack of Twinkles hooves, following behind him.

&nbsp;

The first few doors they came to were ajar. A quick peek in revealed a room with a layout similar to the acid baths. A pit was ringed by a wide landing and a set of narrow steps led down into the center of the opening. But the pit was empty in each.

&nbsp;

Where was that scratching sound *coming* from?

&nbsp;

Then they came to a door that was closed and wouldnt swing open when Tom pushed on it. A tiny plaque to the right of the door labeled the room *Hall of Beetles* in worn and chipped lettering. It looked old. Even the door was aged with dings and gouges.

&nbsp;

Setting the candles down and opening the unlock application on the tablet, Tom entered the demonish symbols for Hall of Beetles. There was a groaning, scraping click of the lock sliding back. The door popped open an inch, just enough for Tom to slip his fingers into. He push it open to a dark room.

&nbsp;

Lifting the light source once again, he stepped into the pitch black.

&nbsp;

Musk comingling with the heavy scent of decay and dust. Toms nose prickled but he moved further into the space. The sound of scratching was coming from this room. It grew louder the deeper he went.

&nbsp;

Several feet past the threshold his toe smacked into the base of something. Reaching out, Tom felt a large square slab of stone that stood about waist high. Atop it lay a metal bowl filled with a thick liquid. Blindly, he dabbed his fingers into it and brought them to his nose.

&nbsp;

Oil.

&nbsp;

Tom plucked a candle from his candelabra and dipped it towards the oil. It lit easily, filling the brazier with flame and illuminating a small section of the room. Several feet away he could just make out the edge of another brazier. He lit that one and the subsequent two. Now a large portion of the right side of the room was aglow in firelight.

&nbsp;

Instead of the typical round room layout this one was rectangular and extended into the shadows, making it larger than any torture chamber theyd been in prior. At the center Tom could see the lip of the pit but where it should have dropped into the ground the stone edge met a metal one that glimmered in the light. Tom moved closer to inspect it.

&nbsp;

Where the two met there was a small space about a fingers width. The metal extended under the lip an inch or more but wasnt flush against the stone work. He tested a foot on the metal and found it solid, holding his weight without bowing. He stepped out towards the center where a thin line revealed itself.

&nbsp;

Crouching, he ran a finger along it. A seam? Were these doors?

&nbsp;

Tomtomgriffin? What is that? Lightfoot asked.

&nbsp;

They werent bricked in. Shut in. Closed off from the light. Its a door. Quick, look for a plaque, an identifier, something we can use to open this.

&nbsp;

Is that wise? Twinkle moved to the edge Tom had stepped off. He looked down at the metal with concern. Wont that release the scarabs?

&nbsp;

I dont think so. The other pits didnt have anything to keep the beetles in. I think this is here to keep people from getting out. 

&nbsp;

But you cant be sure. Twinkle countered, tapping a hoof onto the metal. The hollow clang made the scratching frenzy for a moment before returning to an even pitch.

&nbsp;

Wait in the hall if it suits you, Tom replied with a snap. 

&nbsp;

If any get free we could use your superior strength and stomping abilities to crush the vermin, Lightfoot said.

&nbsp;

Twinkle puffed his chest out. Im not above the influence of flattery and you make a good point. I *do* have superior strength to the lot of you. Very well. But the first sign theyre going to swarm in uncontrollable numbers and Im leaving your ass here Tom. He stepped back off the door and began to circle the edge, looking for a plaque.

&nbsp;

Tom moved to the opposite side and lit several more braziers, filling the chamber with bright light. And heat. It was then Tom realized just how chilled the room had been compared to all the others. Still warm (it was Hell after all) but the rising temperature contrasted heavily against the previous state of the air.

&nbsp;

The hotter it grew, the worse the smell got.

&nbsp;

Smells like death, Twinkle remarked. Tom agreed.

&nbsp;

Whats that, Fancy Feet? Lightfoot pointed to a point on the floor. At the end of the rectangular pit, just before it turned ninety degrees back towards the front, was a small plaque.

&nbsp;

Out loud Twinkle read, Bone Trench.

&nbsp;

That sounds pleasant, Lightfoot said.

&nbsp;

Tom typed in the translation, stretching his thumb over the tablet while balancing the candles on his hip. The doors over the pit creaked and groaned loudly, pulling back and sliding under the rock landing. Unobstructed by the metal the scratching in the pit grew louder, more chaotic. Tom waited for scores of scarabs to spill over the top. Nothing emerged.

&nbsp;

Slowly the sound receded into silence. After a moment longer, Tom craned his neck over the opening to peer down inside. The entire inside was made of metal, dozens of holes lining the walls of the pit. No sign of a single scarab. Had they retreated into the holes? From the light or the opening?

&nbsp;

Tom didnt have time to wonder longer. His eyes were drawn to the contents at the bottom of the pit.

&nbsp;

Skeletal remains.

&nbsp;

Shock rippled through Tom. Were those the men Twinkle had spoken of? There werent a couple remains, there were dozens. More, even, from the number of skulls he could count. At least, Tom guessed they were skulls. It wasnt like ones hed learned about in anatomy. They were oblong shaped with sharper teeth and larger eye sockets.

&nbsp;

Icy horror crept into Toms veins, wringing a shudder from him despite the sweat beading on his skin. II thought you couldnt dienotthis doesnt make sense. He swung his eyes up to Twinkle. Have you heard of peopledying a second time? What is this?

&nbsp;

I havent the faintest idea, Twinkle couldnt tear his gaze away from the pits contents. Lightfoot didnt seem concerned but he, too, was eye-locked onto the skeletons.

&nbsp;

What happened to the soul of someone who died a second time? Died during their supposed *eternal fucking afterlife*? Tom raked a hand through his hair. Hed been working on the assumption that the only thing he had to fear in this place was pain. That no matter what, hed likely regenerate. Itd made him bold.  

&nbsp;

*If a bit foolhardy*, he could hear Eva say.

&nbsp;

But...hed *seen* Eva and Gronak regenerate. 

&nbsp;

Were there wounds that even this place could not heal?

&nbsp;

On the bright side, it doesnt seem like the scarabs want to come out and play, Lightfoot said, breaking the silence.

&nbsp;

Close it. Tom, whatever this is, I dont think we were meant to see it. You said yourself these rooms were marked out on the map. This section appears to have been abandoned and those skeletons were picked clean long ago. Whatever happened hereIm not sure I want to find out. Twinkle sounded strangelyfrightened.

&nbsp;

Was he considering the fact a second death might mean he wouldnt reincarnate? Was he looking at a different kind of mortality and realizing this was about more than surviving a hundred years before being reborn? Was he thinking about what kind of oblivion waited for him on the other side of *that* kind of death? Like Tom himself was this very moment?

&nbsp;

Maybe they just needed to remove the skeletonsperhaps it was part of the torture? Eaten to the bone and then lifted out to regenerate? Tom moved towards the steps, setting down the candelabra at the edge.

&nbsp;

Dont you dare, Tomtomgriffin! Lightfoot yelled.

&nbsp;

I agree. That is unwise, Twinkle added, stepping back from the edge of the pit.

&nbsp;

Ineed to know. Tentatively, he placed a foot onto the top step, looking towards the holes for any signs of the scarabs. Nothing stirred.

&nbsp;

Another step. Then another; each one quicker than the last, till he was waist deep in the pit without a single scarab so much as peeking a tiny head out. His foot pushed against the first layer of skeletal remains, sending it toppling down the small peak itd been resting on.

&nbsp;

Bending over, Tom picked up what looked like a leg bone  possibly an arm?  and held it up. The pressure of his grip broke the brittle bone, sending a shower of dust raining down on his feet. Pressing harder, the bone crumbled entirely, till only fragments remained. Thered be no regenerating from *that*.

&nbsp;

Tom ran back up the steps and tapped the lock button on the tablet, closing the pits doors over the remains with a loud screeching clang.

&nbsp;

Pacing the length of the pit, Tom tried to wrap his mind around what this could mean. He pinged the tablets, noting that Eva and the others had reached the weapon caches. They needed to get back to the main cavern. Warn everyone. The stakes might be higher than any of them had thought possible

&nbsp;

What was that?

&nbsp;

Tom stopped pacing at the edge of where the light from the braziers reached. The back wall was barely illuminated, wavering like a shadow as the flames danced. At eye level Tom could just make out a dark spot, rectangular in shape. Turning back to the steps he lifted the candles and brought them to the wall.

&nbsp;

A small plaque, set into the stone.

&nbsp;

The lettering was caked in soot from the smoke of the braziers and drooped ever so slightly, likely from repeated exposure to such contained heat; itd softened and warped the raised metal. He could almost translate the text, but

&nbsp;

Twinkle, I need your help. Does this say what I think it says? Tom tapped the lettering with the edge of the tablet.

&nbsp;

I really want to leave, Tom. This room feels liketrue death. Twinkle fidgeted.

&nbsp;

Twinkle. Now, Tom grated between clenched teeth.

&nbsp;

Sighing, Twinkle came to stand beside him. Congratulationsyou found a plaque in the middle of the wall Twinkles eyes narrowed as he read the words. Thatsweird.

&nbsp;

Does it say, Cathedral of the Keeper? Tom tapped the lettering again.

&nbsp;

Chapel is closer, Twinkle started, leaning in closer to the plaque.

&nbsp;

Thanks, Tom started to type the words into the unlock application.

&nbsp;

What do you expect that to do? Its a plaque in the middle- Twinkle stopped short when a section of the wall next to the plaque sunk a foot deep and slid to the side, revealing an entrance. How did you know it would do that?

&nbsp;

I didnt. Tom tapped his temple lightly. But neither am I dissuaded by the notion, It might not.

&nbsp;

Lightfoot clapped. Another adventure!

&nbsp;

Tom stood before the dark opening, sucked in a breath, then stepped over the threshold.

&nbsp;

Somewhere in the darkness an electrical whine started up, then light flooded the room as ballast after ballast came alive overhead. The large room was made of white marble and the temperature wassurprisingly cool. Pleasant in fact. There was a breeze ruffling his hair. No wonder the adjoining room had been cooler than the rest of Hell. This room was air conditioned.

&nbsp;

Lavish furniture dotted the room, breaking it up into little segments: a sitting area to the left with large leather chairs and rustic oak end tables; a dining set off to the left with high backed chairs and crystal goblets the color of blood; a four poster canopy bed in the far right corner with gauzy black material hanging like curtains around three of the four sides; a large granite desk to the back left framed by rows of bookcases filled with fat leather wrapped tomes.

&nbsp;

In the center of the room a series of bowls and jugs carved from marble made a fountain and water gently bubbled and spilled from the containers into a wide basin where it disappeared.

&nbsp;

Filling the entire span of the rooms back wall was row upon row of monitors, each looking in on a section of Hell; hallways, assembly rooms, torture rooms, even several empty cells.

&nbsp;

Welcome home, Lord Satan. How may I assist you? said a sultry female voice. Tom recognized it from his first day in Hell. The voice from the tablet, confirming his identity and damning him.

&nbsp;

Bouncing badger balls! You found the Lord of Hells private chambers! Lightfoot exclaimed.
