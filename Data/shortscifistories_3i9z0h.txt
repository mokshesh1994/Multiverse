Courage has never been my strong suite.

I was not a brave man, when they elected to pull the apocryphal asteroid with its regular surfaces and alien words, onto our vessel.

I was not a brave man, as they allowed the creatures from inside what hadn't been an asteroid but - I swear to you - a prison, free roam of our ship.

I was not a brave man, tending the sickened and dying crew as the creatures prowled through our air ducts, and the taste of the paper mask against my mouth was bitter with antiseptic.

I was not a brave man, cowering in the med bay beside the corpse of my last compatriot as the growing creatures paced outside, hungry and waiting, as tears rolled down my face.

I was not a brave man as the creature's claws ripped through the arm I held above my contorted face, a final barrier in my feeble attempts to defend myself.

I was not a brave man, as circuitry and lubricant spilled down out of my arm, spraying the creature as it howled in frustration.

I was not a brave man, as my programming took over and hauled my body towards the nearest computer, undamaged hand raising to rapid-fire Earth's location into the navigation system. Try as I might, I could not stop myself from bringing this horror back with me. I can only pray that it starves before we reach you.

As it turns out, I don't think I was ever a man at all.
