**Chapter 5**

Model 5A, serial number 001572, Tif spoke aloud to Zin.  This is one of the first beacons sent out during the second stage of the search.  None of this makes sense.  It should have used far more fuel than it has.  Tif scratched behind his ear; a nervous tick he'd had since childhood, though he'd deny doing it if you brought it up.  He honestly believed that he didn't do it.

&nbsp;

They really are colossal when you stand next to them, a corporal muttered under his breath as he ran his hand over the impacts along the deflection shield.  His observation was met with slack-jawed nods of agreement from other soldiers.

&nbsp;

I'm pulling the telemetry log now, Zin said to no one in particular.   All present gave equal interest to the beacon and the alien artifact.  The beacons were a marvel of modern achievement for the Alliance; no one in Alliance territory was ignorant to the multilateral effort, but most had never seen a beacon in person.

&nbsp;

Flustered at the peculiar condition of the beacon, Tif chose to divert his attention to the foreign structure; his innate curiosity and problem solving would occupy his mind for long enough to distract his frustration.  In truth, he was terrified, so the opportunity to dive into a different issue calmed his nerves a bit.

&nbsp;

The geometric puzzle next to the beacon was constructed from some sort of mineral alloys.  A wrap of the knuckles on the side returned a solid thud.  The structure was dense; none of the instruments that they'd brought along could reveal any information about its interior, but Tif was too busy studying the markings on the exterior to care about getting inside.

&nbsp;

*These inscriptions,* Tif pondered to himself.  *The swirls are so organic.  The characters look so serene compared to the Alliance standard font.  What race of creatures has the capacity for complex metallurgy and engineering, yet weave art into their precise mathematical work?* His mind raced as he walked around the structure, poking and prodding the artifact to reveal its secrets, when he discovered a series of hemispherical indentations, just big enough to fit a fingertip.

&nbsp;

Aligned horizontally, the circles appeared to have a mathematical nature; first one circle alone, then two side by side, then three aligned as a pyramid, then four as a square and so on from left to right.  When he let his finger glide gently over the rim of the solitary circular indention, it emitted a steady, soft blue glow.  Startled, Tif stumbled back with a guttural snort as two accompanying soldiers re-gripped their rifles.

&nbsp;

What just happened? shouted Msgt Lihn over the comm channel from the staging area at the edge of the clearing.  Who did that?

&nbsp;

What happened? asked Dr. Quitat worriedly from the beacon's data terminal.

&nbsp;

The ELF emission from the artifact just stopped.  Who did that and how? asked the Master Sergeant.

&nbsp;

I did, replied Tif.  He knew that somewhere in a tent a hundred yards away Major Yisan was rolling his eyes, but he was too fascinated to care.  I found what I think may be the entrance, but it's coded, he continued as Dr. Quitat joined him with her own pair of chaperones.

&nbsp;

What did you do? asked Zin.

&nbsp;

I just barely touched the first indent.

&nbsp;

So it's clearly an interface.  You think it opens the structure?

&nbsp;

It's hard to say.  There's a distinct lack of language or identifying marks on the exterior of the monolith.  The logical conclusion is that whoever made this thing either wanted the source to remain a mystery or that there is an abundance of information inside.  I'm betting that this is the way in, Tif convinced himself just as Major Yisan walked up to join the conversation.

&nbsp;

Tune to secure frequency... one point nine nine Charlie, the major ordered.  When all three were on the same channel, the major voiced his concerns.  Before you go pressing any more buttons, doctors, we need to clear this pad.  Unless you can tell me definitively and with absolute certainty what will happen if you enter the correct code, or even more importantly if you enter the wrong code, I cannot let you proceed.

&nbsp;

*"He's not an unreasonable leader,"* Tif thought.  Major Yisan, Zin, and the now six-strong cadre of soldiers followed Tif around the monolith as he scoured for clues to the mystery of the things existence.  After a short while in silence, Tif gave the Major his professional impressions.

&nbsp;

Major, there is no way for me to know the origin or nature of this structure.  I understand that you want to keep this expedition safe, but I believe it is a necessity to attempt entrance.  My opinion is that you remove the Grav beacon from this location and order all non-essential personnel back to the fifteenth floor of the high-rise.  When you are at a safe distance, I will attempt to gain access. 

&nbsp;

Major Yisan decided to lock the beacon in a quarantine bay on one of the remote tow ships of the CAS Vigilant where it could be further analyzed, away from prying eyes.  Once the beacon was discreetly removed via shuttle and the recon teams pulled back to their safe vantage point, Zin and Tif had a go at deciphering the nature of the glyphs.

&nbsp;

Ok... So what do we know?  The first solitary glyph is still lit and the ELF waves have stopped.  That just means that the structure is awaiting further input, right? thought Zin aloud.

&nbsp;

Yes, but for all we know, we may only have one shot at this before the system locks us out, Tif replied while walking around the pyramid again, hunting strenuously for any clues.  There were none.  He returned to the glyphs with an intent stare.

&nbsp;

What about the serial number of the beacon that was here?

&nbsp;

No, said Tif matter-of-factly.  There's no way to know that whoever put this here would understand or use our numbering system.  The answer has to be something more elemental than that; something that all sapient species share, despite dissimilar language or culture.  The two pondered for a moment when Dr. Quitat reached out to touch the indentation of the triple-set that formed a pyramid.  Wait!  What are you trying?

&nbsp;

Primes.  There's only ten sets of indentations here, so I figure walk the primes up to ten.  That proves intelligence, right?  Zin said confidently.

&nbsp;

Are we sure it's that simple? Tif asked weerily, to which Dr. Quitat shrugged.

&nbsp;

You said elemental.  What's more elemental than primes?  Zin touched the tip of her fingers along the set of tri-indentations and immediately the first solitary circle went dark.  Over the comm-channel came Msgt Lihn.

&nbsp;

ELF emanation pattern is back up.  Whatever you guys did didn't work... did it?  Tif and Zin exchanged glances.  While Zin reported back to the Major asking for suggestions, Tif stepped back to take the structure into full view.  He thought back to the artistic nature of the inscriptions on the side of the structure; the swirling patterns and sweeping lines.

&nbsp;

Tell him to hold for just one moment, Tif said as he stepped forward towards the glyphs.

&nbsp;

Hold just one moment, Major, Tif might have something, Zin reported back.

&nbsp;

Artists, Tif muttered as he grazed the solitary first glyph which lit a solid blue again.

&nbsp;

What? asked Dr. Quitat in confusion while Msgt Lihn said something unintelligible over the comm-channel.

&nbsp;

They're artists, he replied as he pressed the single glyph again.  It responded by blinking at a moderate pace.  He then pressed the pair of circles and the trio in quick succession, to which the three pressed glyphs blinked rapidly in unison.

&nbsp;

I don't think you can just walk up the glyphs like that, Tif.  But Tif paid no attention to his colleague, skipping the fourth and pressing the glyph with 5 circles.  Tif then turned to Zin, and with a sly grin keyed the comm-channel to bring Major Yisan, MSgt Lihn, and the rest of the crew at the 15th story observatory into the conversation.

&nbsp;

Are you ready for this? he asked cryptically just before pressing the glyph of eight.  All the pressed glyphs then flashed green three times before going dark.

&nbsp;

Very impressive, Dr. Vanseen, Zin said sarcastically.  I'll be sure to record that one for post- she was interrupted by an explosion overhead.  It came from the CAS Vigilant, but more specifically a tow ship.  Major Yisan came over the comm-channel.

&nbsp;

I don't know what you two did, but you'd better get the fuck out of there. Yesterday! Tif and Zin looked at each other with perplexed panic.  The beacon just activated and it's headed for ground zero.  Move!

&nbsp;

Tif and Zin barely had time to put 100 meters between them and the structure when the beacon came crashing down at impossible speed.  The sound of the collision was incredible; temporarily deafening even through their enviro-suits.  When the dust settled and the pair pulled themselves to their feet with ringing ears, they were awed by the spectacle before them.  The spherical beacon, titanic in comparison, balanced beautifully upon the summit of the pyramid.  Both were perfectly intact.  As they watched, seams appeared in the surface around the glyphs and a door faded away.

&nbsp;

Okay so. Three things, Msgt Lihn began over the comms as they walked back toward the artifact.  One, Bidor is super pissed.  Two, both the Grav beacon and the pyramid are now emitting a synchronized ELF pattern.

&nbsp;

And three? Zin asked with heaving breath.

&nbsp;

Just between us, the master sergeant replied softly, that looked fucking awesome from up here.  Already at the doorway, Tif replied with a bit more concern.

&nbsp;

Yeah, well, I think I've got something to trump all of that. Tif pointed inside as Zin shakily walked up. One: this structure was a mirco-habitat.  Two, the occupant is still inside.  Three, whatever it was, it's long dead.
