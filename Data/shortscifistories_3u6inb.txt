Through the looking glass

His "precancerous" condition was now actively spreading throughout his body.  No, it wasn't painful yet.  It started with high lab values several months ago.  Now countless thousands of dollars, numerous office and hospital visits, and several calls to his insurance company later, Jeffrey found himself sitting at his roomy workstation in his extremely comfortable swivel chair.  His daughter Lauren loved that chair and would play on it for hours.  He was doing this for her, as he had made his mind up soon after they suggested his health might be at stake.  He could still teach her everything he had ever meant to, although the conversation would decidedly be only one-way.

Furiously pounding away at his keyboard, Jeff sometimes stopped for a brief moment to admire his work.  Countless thoughts, memories, adventures, desires and dreams were constantly being transferred by him into the Cloud.  Jeff kept track of all of it in a master database; what went here, what went there.  He wrote a review article for this site, commented on this forum, uploaded a funny GIF or a short youtube vid.  Bits and pieces of a life and a personality.  Jeff liked to joke that, given enough time, he could even upload his soul.

When the service concluded, Lauren's aunt handed her the flash drive.  Wiping away the tears, she turned the small plastic device over and read the inscription.  Find me.

The stage was set for arguably the most astounding experiment in human history.  Space, as it turned out, besides expanding, had periodic boundary conditions.  The known universe had since become the entire universe.  The sum total of all of the electromagnetic radiation could be retrieved and queried.  Unbelievably sophisticated instruments and programs had been developed to peer into the past.  Almost all of the flavors of quantum particles could be entangled and dis-entangled.  Enough to reconstruct many curious and amazing objects which had long since come and gone.

Lauren took her place at the console before leaning back in her favorite swivel chair.  Meaning could almost always be found in even the tiniest bits of data.  A review article, comment, funny GIF or youtube vid, coupled with incredible technology, could uncover a life and a personality.  But with Lauren's final modifications, could it even uncover a soul?

The switch was flipped, but there was no audible sound (the device was incredibly efficient).  The only difference was the man sitting in a chair in the middle of the reconstitution pad.  Lauren and her dad immediately had the same question: where did the other chair come from?
