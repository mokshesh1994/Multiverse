[mini] Last Contact

He soared again, after millennia of planet-bound life, he was amidst the stars once more. It felt so strange, so ethereal, and yet so familiar. He chuckled, almost like riding a bike. The rest of his collective sent a wave of mild surprise at his emotional outburst. He contracted his mind a bit, bringing thoughts closer together. Even communicating at the speed of light, his neuronal units formed a loosely bound cloud several AUs in circumference, it didnt so much slow his thought as fragment it. It was not wholly unpleasant but hed always preferred his collective as unified as possible. He was a bit of an old-timer in that regard, and there was a long ways to go.

The first tendrils of his destination swept through his forward limbs. The beautifully tasting Homunculus nebula tingled all across the spectrum of his senses, like a ghostly soft touch or almost imperceptible musical notes. He allowed the thoughtless sensation to wash over him as he started to decelerate, pulling himself ever and ever tighter. Eta Carinae, the arcane name had a pleasant sound to it. She had made him wait for a very long time. Mere centuries ago his scout parties had finally let him know that she had started her last, spectacular dance. He had almost feared he would arrive too late. But there she was, in all her magnificent, terrible glory. As he glided ever closer, the sensations changed, the nebula no longer brushed past him, it was now a steady surge, like an incoming tide trying to push him back. The power behind this mass-exodus of gasses, high-charged particles and hard radiation was nearly unfathomable. He smiled a starry smile and started the necessary adaptations.

He regarded himself. He had not taken this form for a long time. Granted it was about a thousand times the size it had originally been, but no human sized form, no matter how cleverly made, could have withstood the forces this close to the center. He had dressed himself in the robes of a Buddhist monk, head shaven and glimmering with the reflection of the most incredible event this side of time. Heavens altar roared before him, a twin engine of creation and destruction. The fabric of his body was continuously assaulted as space-time itself contorted and thrashed in the grasp of the dying double-star. He paid it little heed, the collective would keep him together for as long as needed. And when Eta Carina would finally blow, it would remake her birth ground with such incredible force that he would be scattered beyond return, no matter how much exotic energy had kept him together so far. All that had been pushed to the back of his mind. It had been a very long time since hed felt nervous, but now his senses were spread and sweeping his surrounding in broad repeating strokes.

He felt Her.

&nbsp;

If he had had lungs, he would have sighed in relief. She had just cleared the outer edge of the main nebula, fashionably late as always. Memories of long forgotten times flooded over him. As he trained all his senses on her, forgetting even the violence around him, her beauty overtook him, as it always had. She wore a simple red dress, fitting her form perfectly. Eta Carinae was reflected in her eyes and made all the more intimately spectacular by it. She had also brought a tree. Mythical in its proportions, even compared to her impressive size, its branches were bare and its trunk almost dead, save for a lonely patch of brown bark near the bottom. He did not think he could have loved her more than he already did, and yet she had proved him wrong once more. Wordlessly she crossed the distance between them. Gently he retracted his senses, as he felt her do the same. When she finally reached him, he saw no more than what his eyes allowed him, and felt no more than what his skin told him. Their lips touched softly, a kiss millions of years overdue. There was no need for words. A promise made so unimaginably long ago, neither of them had known for certain whether it had actually ever happened. So many civilizations had risen and fallen. Countless stars had been born and collapsed. Humanity itself had been stretched so far beyond recognition, made into myth and eventually forgotten, that it had become an utterly meaningless term. They had travelled so far and so long, had transformed and reimagined and lost themselves so many times that even their own names had escaped them. Yet here they were.

They held hands and sat beneath the tree by the raging light of a galaxy ender. The wait was over.
