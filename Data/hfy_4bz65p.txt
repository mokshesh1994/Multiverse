[OC] On the Complexities of an Alpha Predator

Here's an idea...

On Earth, there are an estimated 6,500 languages spoken today. In one of those languages - this language, to be exact - there are 26 letters that can be arranged in groups (averaging 5.1 letters in length) to form an estimated 1,025,110 words. Every words is an idea. When you combine two words, you get 1,025,110^2 ideas. Three words, and you get 1,025,110^3 ideas, and so on. Sure, some of those ideas are common and dull while others are nonsensical, but the point remains.

There are a lot of ideas.

Now, the average speaker of this particular language can speak, on average, 130 words per minute, and the average complete sentence is 14 words. That's roughly nine arbitrarily complex and abstract ideas within a minute, and that's at a leisurely pace. Imagine how fast that speaker could talk if they were pressed for time.

Animals, on the other hand, have only a small inventory of meaningful signs - equivalent to words - and they cannot recombine them into new and meaningful ways. What they know how to "say" is all they will ever know how to say. If they encounter something new, an animal will have to reuse the "words" they know and hope the message gets across, but a human can create a totally new linguistic idea and be understood almost instantly.

Then, there's the fact that we humans can store our ideas in a physical form, such that a later human can learn from it. No teacher, no experience, and no mimicry is needed; the reader can see and know the information without ever seeing the original source, and can in turn pass that information on himself.

So if someone ever asks why we weak, scrawny humans are the Alpha Predators, you just say: "For us, it's as easy as [*A-B-C.*](https://youtu.be/ho7796-au8U?t=15s)"
