**Chapter 2**

Tif fiddled with the display on the arm of his expeditionary suit.  There were no signs of unusual levels of chemicals, biomass, or radiation, but no one was taking any chances.  The expedition started in Penkil, Haatis megalopolis, where the worlds cultural, business, and political centers converged.

&nbsp;
 
There was something deeply unsettling about the state of Penkil.  Aside from scientists, security escorts, and ROVs fanning out across the sprawling capital, the only signs of life in this once vivacious paradise were the occasional raptor or scavenger.  A planetary time capsule, the entire region looked as if everyone had decided to take vacation off-world at the same instant.  On some streets, the remnants of gruesome wrecks held traffic patterns in gridlock, while other streets were abandoned as far as the eye could see.  At business fronts, images of daily routine were in still-life; delivery trucks remained open with cargo exposed, doors wedged open for the wildlife and creeping weeds to infiltrate stale office spaces, and faded signs beckoned customers into mildewed storefronts for long expired sales.

&nbsp;

To see such a robust and cultured cosmopolitan arena, with its cloud-reaching spires and wonderful architectural forms, reduced to a gallery of crumbling infrastructure and feral tenants was sickeningly surreal.  Tif deeply regretted suggesting touchdown here.  Everything about this felt wrong, but he couldnt quite place the feeling of something more elemental missing from such a devastating scene; a nagging itch that he couldnt pin down.

&nbsp;

This was a death world, alright, and it was fighting to claim what it had been denied for millennia.  Once home to two billion souls, the light of civilization no longer burned here and the darkness was quick to winds its constrictions tight.

&nbsp;

We didnt want to come crashing in to this global cemetery with thousands upon thousands of personnel; we wanted to tread lightly, both out of respect and of fear.  The majority of the expedition remained off-ground as our eyes and ears; of the twenty-five teams that were sent to the major metropolises and conurbations, Tif was in the group that was sent to the capital.  While other ancillary crews were sweeping the oceans, jungles, and deserts, Zin and Tifs team was under the scrupulous and ever-watching eyes of Admiral Bidor, who was parked in geo-stationary orbit above Penkil.

&nbsp;

While Zin and her sub-crew headed straight for the political district, Tif and his crew headed for the cultural center where he had spent his graduate years, ultimately writing his thesis on *Interspecies Subconscious Non-verbal Communication*.  As they approached the districts hub, the dread in Tifs stomach welled up to his throat.  So many brisk morning runs and afternoon lunches spent in the central park; evenings with countless failed dates at the outdoor theatre; telescopic eavesdropping sessions to support his thesis.  All those memories were drowned out by the stale silence.  Even the specials forces operators exchanged hesitant glances as they stood at the entrance to the park, the literal center of the cultural district.

&nbsp;

Bodies, Tif whispered and one of the soldiers paused his weapons check to look Tif dead in the eye.  He had finally nailed down the itch.

&nbsp;

What did you say? asked the corporal.

&nbsp;

Penkil was a cultural beacon for this whole sector of the Core.  There were around two billion residents at last census, not to mention how many tourists.

&nbsp;

We all know the stats, Dr. Vanseen, chirped Major Yisan.  Whats your point?

&nbsp;

My point, Major, and pardon my language, is where the fuck is everyone?

&nbsp;

Excuse me? replied the Major, shocked at Tifs tone.

&nbsp;

The bodies, Major.  Where are the remains? Tif implored.  There is no physical way that the local flora and fauna could have decomposed or otherwise removed all trace of every single corpse from the event until now, he paused as the realization slowly dawned on the entire crew.  Think about it.  Have you seen any trace of sapients from any of the Alliance nations since weve been on the ground?  Tif keyed his radio.

&nbsp;

Dr. Zin Quitat, this is Dr. Tif Vanseen.  Do you copy?  Tif called to his supervisor miles away.  Silence reigned while the Major looked down the pathway entrance of the park.

&nbsp;

Dr. Quitat here.  Whats up Tif? came the crystal clear response.

&nbsp;

Zin, Tif paused, has anyone in your crew seen corpses?  There was a long pause.

&nbsp;

No.  We havent seen a damned thing.  We havent even seen any blood, for that matter.  Its like everyone up and left at the same time. Silence.  Why? Have you? she asked tentatively.

&nbsp;

No.  Well keep you posted with any changes.  Tif out.

&nbsp;

Desperately searching for any reason to avoid entry into the wooded area, Tif stalled.  Despite him being rather sure that nothing of significance would be found in a recreational park, the imagery still elicited a deep sense of foreboding in the primal cortex of his brain.  While he delayed, checking and rechecking his sensors and experimental equipment, the spec-ops teams technical operator dispatched an aerial ROV.  Within moments, the operators eyes glazed and his jaw dropped.

&nbsp;
  
What is it, Sergeant? asked Major Yisan.  He received no response.  Sergeant? he demanded.

&nbsp;

We need altitude, Master Sergeant Lihn said before commanding the ROV into auto-pilot and stuffing his monitor into his front pouch, then grabbing his personal mag-rail rifle and high-tailing it to the nearest sky-scraper.

&nbsp;
  
Not understanding the suddenness of his movement, the crews instincts drove them to hurriedly follow him to the building.  Their blood ran cold as the primitive elements of their brains told them that they were being chased by something seen only by the Master Sergeant.  They ran for their lives.  They raced through the entrance and up the closest flight of stairs, startling several animals out of their slumber behind a concierge desk.  They chased MSgt Lihn all the way to the fifteenth floor, never stopping to question why they were running.

&nbsp;

When they arrived at the emergency egress door, the marines swept the floor for hostile contact while the scientists panted with nausea at the entryway.  Within moments, those who werent armed received the all-clear and met the soldiers at the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over the vast expanse of park below.  Nestled at the convergence of roadways, rivers, and architectural marvels, the park was a 5mi by 5mi jewel of conservation; a reminder of the natural world that had elsewhere been conquered and replaced by civilization.

&nbsp;

All of the crew stood staring out as MSgt Lihn retrieved his controller and began to sweep the ROV in for a closer look.

&nbsp;

Well, Doctor, the Major broke the silence.  What the hell do you suppose that is?
