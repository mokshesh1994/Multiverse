First Time Colonizers
blinka
Atom was lying on the couch when his hyper comm link, or HCL for short, beeped.  He glanced down at the digital display, and then, waiting for a moment of silence in-between food processor pulses, called to his wife, Lora, who was making brunch in the kitchen.


New results, babe!


Lora pulsed the cole-slaw once again before responding, Anything good?


Atom scrolled through the list of entries on his HCL before replying, Theres a bunch of new ones, including some systems we havent seen before.  Come over and lets take a look together.


Lora emptied the cole-slaw into a mixing bowl and placed it in the fridge before joining her husband on the couch.  A quick thought turned on the television.  A second brought up her digital inbox.  Finally a third opened the msg from Colonial Associates.  She looked at her husband of almost a year and asked, Shall I continue to drive or do you want to take control?.


Nah you are good, open the first entry.

Atom and Lora looked through the photos of AB-3.  Pristine blue skies and seas, sparse nebulous clouds, and large terran palms adorned the various pictures of the archipelagos that littered the planets surface.


Sure looks nice. said Lora with a sad edge already creeping into her voice, How much?


Atom clicked on the details page for AB-3.  He sighed, 575 million, about 375 million more than we can afford.


Im not too surprised, replied Lora, beachfront property has always been expensive.  Lets keep looking.

Long term contracts with Lifeworks Corporation ensures a steady stream of air and water at a locked-in and competitive rate for all future colonists!  Reserve your parcel today!


Not too bad.  You cant even tell you are living on the inside of a rock, said Lora as they browsed the pictures accompanying the profile.


I know its come a long way in the last hundred years but I cant quite shake the fear associated with the risks of asteroid living, replied Atom.


Perhaps other future colonists share that same sentiment.  How much?


Are you kidding me?! Atom moaned as they both stared at a 389 million dollar price tag, Who can afford these places?


Lora took her husbands hand in hers, Lets go back and look at that one we found last week.  The one in the Locke system.


Atom took control of the console and brought up a search form before turning to his wife, Do you remember the parameters?


I think it was primarily desert, with a natural atmosphere of 72% Terran and 1.25G.  The parcel we were looking at was 185 million.  Its not perfect but its a decent starter home and they say a little rough living builds character, right?


Atom spent a few seconds searching for the planet but came up empty-handed, Im not seeing it.  Hold on, let me broaden the search.  A moment passed, There it is.

Atom raised his gaze to meet Loras.  A look of gloom across both their faces.  Atom shook his head,  Unbelievable.
