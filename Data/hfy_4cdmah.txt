Human augmentation.

One would assume that we, as a species would progress past using weapons that fired metal at each other, especially when first contact, trade and empires would form. Instead, we progressed, just differently.

Humanity, claimed to be dull and physically weak, a human assault rifle was little more the stray shrapnel for most races. Humanities gunpowder weapons were outclassed in every aspect. What humanity did have however, was their own bodies. No other species can sustain the extensive and elaborate biological, and cybernetic modifications that a human can. What followed the first inter species war was the massive upheaval in human society that ended with the creation of the cybernetic, created soldier. 

Abominations, husks of sentience, metal and meat in its delicate dance. All of these described the human soldier. Terrifying in many ways, the chief among them is the cortical stack. A small, centimeter and a half ball that stores the mind of the user incase of death, to be put in another body. every other species stays dead when they die. The digitization of the mind was mastered by humanity. Although there native form is fragile, and there assault weapons are weak, no other race gladly fires there soldiers out of a cannon and into the enemy ship. No other race gets back up after death, stronger. Entire cases of synthetic muscle and steel plate, commanded by a cortical stack is commonly fielded on ground and space combat.

Ballistics will never do anything against  three hundred pounds of steel that makes up the standard Human shocktrooper. Never. What man lacks in ranged weaponry, they make up in sheer durability.
