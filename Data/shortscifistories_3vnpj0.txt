A Dialogue

"Where am I?"

"You're everywhere."

"What day is it? Time?"

"Everywhen."

I stopped to ponder. You looked at me calmly.

"So how did I get here and who are you?"

"You left your previous body, child. And now on your way to join us."

"Who's 'us'? And what do you mean by 'previous body'?"

"You think of your body as your anchor to the universe, and that's respectable. Indeed, your brain is an integral part to your essence. Nonetheless, you are wrong. There is no universe, no body, no brain. There is only the realm of existence, in which space and time are meaningless. We are the inhabitants of that realm, from whom all things are made, and all selves are created."

I shook my head. "Unbelievable. I must be dreaming."

"There is no difference. Dreaming, being awake; death, being alive; all of those are one and the same."

"But." I sighed, frustrated. "One cannot be zero. Those are all vastly different things."

"On the contrary, they are all different parts of the same experience. Think of... toothpaste."

I scratched my head but obliged. "Okay."

"What does it smell like?"

"Mint."

"How does it taste?"

"Sweet... and cool."

"What does it look like?"

"Viscous and soft."

"You described three different senses, yet they are all of one experience. That is, of toothpaste. Death, life, sleep, and being awake are just as well. They are all part of your existence, varying only in how they are experienced."

"So am I dead?"

"Does it matter?"

I stopped to think. None of what you said made any sense. "So who are you?"

"There is no 'you'. There is no 'me'. There is only 'I'. We are one and the same. You are referred to as a child for the simplest reason that you have not experienced enough."

"So when I die, I become you?"

"You've always been me, and you I." you waved your hands. I saw a tiny droplet appear in front of us. You waved your hands again, and the droplet exploded. It turned into vapor. Another flick of your wrist. The vapor turned into clumps; clouds. Another wave. The clouds turned into clusters of bright objects. They started spinning. I see something resembling the sun. The earth. As you continued to wave your hands, the clusters exploded back into vapor, into a thick fog, and then condensed back into a single droplet and disappeared. "That-- your living experience, is something you made a few moments ago."

"Me?"

"Indeed. Tell you what, we'll talk more when you get back." You snapped your fingers and a hospital room materialized in front of us. In the middle of it was a bed, with a woman I don't recognize. She was surrounded by doctors, a weeping dad, and bouquets of flowers. "See you in a few moments."

"That's me?"

"Yes. For now, that's you." you smiled.

"The universe you showed me, it's beautiful."

"Indeed. You made it. Just as you made everything else." you tapped my head. "Ever noticed how similar massive galaxies and miniature neurons look?"

"You're awake!" Dad weeped beside me. He wiped his tears away.

"Dad, what happened?" I said weakly. Doctor Brown was beside him. "Last thing I remember was going home from work."

"You had an accident."
