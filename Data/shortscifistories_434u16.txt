"Immortality is a curse."
Navaii1
"When you are immortal you are insane, you keep living but you want to die, at the same time you want to keep living. It is a curse, not a gift. Even if you master it is haunts you, it is a curse, not a gift. Even if you like it then you are insane, it is a curse not a gift. Immortality is nothing but a curse in disguise of a gift, no matter what way you look at it. That is why only one immortal is left at the end of the Universe and not three, not two, just 1. Just one soul who dared to be insane, who dared to loose it all, just so he could see the last stars burn out. You know what he did? Burned out with them because immortality is a curse where you see your friends and family die, the last star burn out, and be lonely for as long as you live. He simply picked up a knife and got his life over it, immortality is a curse." Says Qwen Tun in his deep, robotic voice. These are his last words before he dies, facing the death penalty for bombing the Federal Trade Center for 'stealing' money from the Public. Immortality is a curse, mortality is a gift.
