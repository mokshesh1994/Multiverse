[BIOTECH] [OC] Hellhound

The loneliness was the worst.

&nbsp;

No matter the wormholes plotted, the warp trails left, or the Dyson swarms constructed, the loneliness persisted.  No other species answered the gravitic waves, EMP bursts, light signals or yells of exasperation.  Only radiation-scarred crags and ammonia rains stood as silent witnesses of their passing.

&nbsp;

And so the violence swam forth from the lonely heart of Gralf.  He was a self-styled warrior in a race of explorers.  But less than a warrior, for his war was of his own making.  He needed no clan or tribe, no friend or lover.  And so he destroyed for the fun of it.  When others turned to societal comforts and internal development, Gralf rent asunder the works of others.  He destroyed for the simple and ethereal thrill that comes from denying.  Denying others of life, liberty, goods, or worst of all, hope.

&nbsp;

"You'll not  get away with  this, Gralf.  Someone will  stop you," panted the lone remaining Sentinel on the platform.  Your  sick game  will  not last.  He struggled getting the words out, through a collapsed lung and the burn of nanotube fibers from his splintered armor sawing against every motion.

&nbsp;

One thing you have gotten correct, you are but just a game to me.  I could have ended all of you in a moment, but I feel no hurry.  I enjoy my work, just as your dark-matter miners did before they took their last breath.

&nbsp;

Gralfs talon-like nails clicked on the plastisteel decking as he rounded the corner and saw the Sentinel, Faan, with his own eyes.  Such a pathetic creature, ill-suited to his task as all the Sentinels had proven thus far.  Hastily convened, they showed little skill or cunning.

&nbsp;

I tire of this chase, Faan.  Look around you!  This structure will serve as my Throne of Despair as I throw off the gravitational stability of the whole sector from this perch of twisting spacetime.  As I revel in this howling maelstrom, Ill disturb ellipticals for a kiloparsec.

&nbsp;

Faans single working limb pushed him up into a sitting position to stare at Gralf.

&nbsp;

You  wouldnt.  You  mon  STER!  The last syllable was a squeak of pain and uncomprehending terror.

&nbsp;

Gralf licked his muzzle and laughed.

&nbsp;

Oh, but I would.  Ill gaze into the maw of disaster and send planets off from their stars, combine gas giants into new protostars, and change the angle of pulsars.  Ill write my name in the fabric of reality.  And when Im done, Ill move to another galactic arm and begin again.

&nbsp;

He took three steps closer to his prey and crouched down on one knee.  Hate filled his eyes and spittle flecked off of his fangs as the monologue reached a fever pitch.

&nbsp;

You are alone!  No savior or packmate to be found!  The only solace youll find is that your pain will end before your home planet is bombarded by Oort cloud ammunition!  THEY WILL ALL DIE!!!

&nbsp;

Gralf grabbed Faan by the breastpiece and hauled him up into the air, bioengineered and artificial muscles making the armor-clad Sentinel seem to be massless.

&nbsp;

No  Gralf.  The Masters  will  stop  you.  His pinched esophagus could only manage a hoarse whisper, but his intent was sure and strong.

&nbsp;

Ha!  The Masters are a nighttime tale told to keep pups in line!  Dont tell me you still believe the old stories, where are your Masters NOW?!

&nbsp;

Pain lanced through Faan as his life support began to fail under the crushing grip of Gralfs enhanced clutch.  His vision blurred and started to tunnel black around the edges.  The end was near.

&nbsp;

Thats enough.

&nbsp;

A voice came from nowhere and everywhere simultaneously.  Behind Gralf the air itself began to waver and arc with immense power.  He turned his head to see what his sensors couldnt define:  tendrils of extra-dimensional matter leaping out and depositing a bipedal being into his sight.

&nbsp;

Who ARE you?!

&nbsp;

The beings eyes shifted from Faan to him, the gathered brows he saw there causing a deeply buried reaction to surface.  His head lowered and ears folded back involuntarily.  Mind racing, body acting unbidden, his hackles raised and eyes averted.

&nbsp;

It was definitely female, slender of build and small of height, and wore a simple off-white linen gown.  She had a striking face without a snout and with no fur, except for that found on the top of her head; such that was there fell in cascading waves of auburn curls. He knew the answer before the creature spoke.

&nbsp;

You call me a Master.  And I do not approve of your actions.

&nbsp;

How dare she!  A snarl of rebellion snaked across his lips as he activated his combat AI.  A cloud of defensive utility fog swirled around him as he rose to his full height and deployed his full cache of weapons.

&nbsp;

Master, huh?  I shall see if your flesh is any sweeter than my own kind.

&nbsp;

Lasers and masers erupted from his weapons suite, turning the air around him to plasma trails.  Micro missiles braided around antimatter dustings as spacetime tesseracted into a chaotic soup of destruction.  Tactical singularities followed gamma ray bursts followed relativistically accelerated carbon bombs.  A hellscape storm that the Hellhound stood at the eye of.

&nbsp;

And yet, there was no damage done to the invader or the structure around him.  A coherent bubble of force brushed off all attacks and let in not even a breeze to bother its inhabitant.  A serene look of disappointment filled her countenance.

&nbsp;

Fine, well do this the FUN WAY!!! He roared and gravity boosted toward her, baring his claws.  The Claws of Gralf, feared everywhere.  Built of solid hydrogen with each electron collapsed to lie tight against its nucleus, nothing was stronger.  Painted with higher-dimensionally-perfect glyphs of dark matter, they could bypass any defense yet devised and deliver death directly to the heart.
He scratched at the surface of the impermeable wall, hooking his claws into crevices of energy.  Time slowed with the speed of his attacks, incalculable power behind each swipe.

&nbsp;

And yet, still no damage was done.  One by one his claws shattered, solids sublimating into gas at the tips of his fingers.  The attack weakened and stopped.  Chest heaving, capacitors drained, and smart-matter blood seeping from self-inflicted wounds, Gralf stared wide-eyed at the unharmed Master.

&nbsp;

She raised her eyebrow and his nanobot utility fog fell to component atoms, strong nuclear tidal forces washing over him and removing all offending components.  Higgs fields formed around him and mass itself held his limbs still.  Calabi-Yau membranes unfolded and gripped him in 9-dimensional shackles, affording no ability to shift away from punishment.

&nbsp;

What are you going to do to me?  What kind of horrible tortures have you planned?

&nbsp;

His mind raced, imagining being stretched for infinity along the event horizon of a supermassive black hole.  Or left to drift in a coffin between galactic superclusters.  Or being bound to an asteroid on a long ecliptic path, forever to burn and freeze.  But with an eternity of pain came an eternity to find escape.  His reign would not be over.

&nbsp;

None.  The wages of your insurrection is eternal nothingness.  You will be put to sleep.

&nbsp;

The last thing Gralf heard before his consciousness ceased was his judgement being proclaimed.

&nbsp;

You are a bad dog.
