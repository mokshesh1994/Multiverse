[Biotech] The First Day

First day on Sewer Duty?

Now, this job isn't around just to satisfy the veterans who want to be useful. We can't use bio-drones down here, so we rely on good old fashioned human labor, from fine folks like you.

The first day's always jarring, cause you don't realize just how much stuff is under your feet. Used to be pretty small, but apparently those new organic buildings needed to empty their waste somewhere, so the tunnels got bigger. And then those tunnels needed to host refuse algae tanks, and the bacteria farms, and eventually it turned into this.

The raw smell would knock you off your feet, maybe literally, so they give you the re-breather. Of course it still feels like your nose is being invaded by Satan. I still don't know if they actually work, or if they're just some kind of sadistic placebo, but nobody has been stupid enough to take one off down here. With any luck you're not stupid enough either.

There are obvious guidelines: don't lick the walls, refrain from swimming in the liquid waste, stay on the walkways, common sense stuff. Report any leaking membranes or pipes, mechanical and organic failures. Stay on your toes, follow the signs and you should be fine. Oh, also, never light an open flame. Ever. There is a reason your firearm works on compressed air.

Oh, the firearm? Yeah, that's the reason we can't just use some bio-organic critter instead. It turns out some beasties make their homes down here, and they aren't welcome. Lots of abandoned grow-your-own pet kits, the odd Rat-roach, that kind of stuff. Some of them can really do a number on you. General rule, if it has more than two legs and moves, shoot. Keeps the tunnels clear, we don't want any unwanted ecosystems forming. Trust me, we learned that lesson the hard way.

I know the job sucks. But someone's gotta do it, you know? Every bit of filth in this city ends up down here. If something breaks, people notice. If it leaks, people *really* notice. Our job is make sure that doesn't happen. You'll never get recognized, but it's important stuff. Everyone up there is relying on us to keep everything running smoothly, even if they don't know it. Anyone accepted for Sewer Duty is among the best of the best.

Well, except for Jeff. He used a lighter down here once. You'll pass the scorch marks going towards Chamber Seven. 

Welcome to the force.
