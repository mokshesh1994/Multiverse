They Said They'd Fixed Me

They injected with me just enough cerebrostimulant to reactivate the parts of my brain that have been damaged from the accident. The doctor told me that after I take my afternoon nap, everything should be very close to normal, and pristine a few days thereafter.

But when I woke up that afternoon, there was nobody. The hospital was empty. The streets were empty. I ran, and ran... and ran. And I saw nobody.

Everybody disappeared.

That was two years ago.

I feel so alone that I've tried to kill myself over and over. I slit my wrists. I jumped off the Golden Gate. Heck, I even emptied the pharmacy on myself. Yet each time, I just wake up on the hospital bed, exactly the same as the first time.

They said they'd fixed my condition. They said they'd fixed me. But what did they really do?

I'm now trapped in a world that's truly, horrifyingly just my own.

And I think I'll be here forever, with no chance of escape.

Not even in death.
