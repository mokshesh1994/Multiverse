   Cold icy wind rushed rushed past Seth's face as he desperately tried to reach out and grab a hold of something within his vicinity. His arms felt like they were suddenly shocked into life and obtained a life of their own knowing, immediately, what to do. His legs kicked in the air as if they were trying , in some sort of heated attempt, to maneuver his body into landing somewhere safe down below. His torso jerked and twisted as he made the sudden realization that he was going to fail and would not be able to save himself. He hit the floor with an impact that would make glass shatter in an instant.

   Seth... fell out of his bed this morning.
