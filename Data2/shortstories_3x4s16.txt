I pulled up to the hospital and immediately started to question if I should even be there. When I heard Zuri was in the hospital, I didnt have much of a reaction. I responded with a calm Okay, thanks for letting me know. My roommate, on the other hand, heard my phone on speaker from the next room and rushed over in a panic. 
Did they find her? Is she okay? 
Yeah, shes at Lakeview getting observed. I replied and went back to sketching my final landscape piece for the week. Chris walked towards his dresser and grabbed his jacket and keys.
Dont worry, Ill drive. He spoke as he walked towards the door. He froze when he realized I hadnt moved from my seat. What are you doing? He asked with a perplexed visage.
Oh, I have to submit this piece in the morning. Why, whats up? I was just as confused as he was.
Your girl is in the hospital, man. Why are you acting so nonchalant? He spoke with a touch of anger which didnt make any sense to me. I went back to my sketch and allowed the conversation to fall into silence.
I arrived at Lakeview Medical Center with a bouquet of white peonies that Chris picked on our way. I had no idea what youre supposed to do in situations like this but Chris said get flowers so I listened. I had a feeling I wasnt on the top of the list Zuri would wanted to see but I went anyway.
