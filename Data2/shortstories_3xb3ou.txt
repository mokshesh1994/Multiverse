Every sentence can lead you anywhere that I can't imagine. A story so descriptive still won't be the same for each person. So how am I supposed to get my ideas across the way I intend them to be? What if the story only works because the way I visualise it is the only way it can work? 

Maybe I am sick of the way I see things and no matter how hard I try I can't think like you. The colours you envision and the feelings you can relate to better because you have more experience than me. You have seen more than me to make my stories better than I ever could have wanted. OR... Maybe you lack what I have and because my mind is so different I can see sense in things you can't.

I want to imagine like you do. A red coast setting in a dream-like world were the sand is untouched. Take me to another world. Take me to your world. I could read a thousand of your stories and still not see it as incredible as you. I want you to brainwash me to be like you. I want your memories to be mine and I want your appearance to be mine so I can get what I want. Let us swap bodies forever because I don't want to be restricted to a lifetime of my own thoughts. How can I escape me? When I die am I stuck with my thoughts?

Before I die do this one wish for me. Make a language that forces each word to have only one way of seeing things. I will read it until my own thoughts are foreign. I will never add words. I want your dreams. Don't get me wrong.. I don't want you, I want to be you.
