This used to be a beautiful place. It used to be full of wonderful people and magnificent sights. Now it is a mere metal monster where my memories used to be.

We were a race exiled by the Universal Committee long before I was born, considered aliens. Ever since the humans joined this Committee it has never been the same and they seemed threatened by anything unfamiliar to them. Our large, bulbous heads probably scared them. Our scent detectors  nostrils to the humans  were probably in the wrong place on our forehead. Maybe they didnt like the purple of our skin, or the fact that our arms each have four fingers, two curving one way and two curving the other.

It is true that our bodies are a tenth of the size of our heads. Our feet are small and we cannot walk so we have to rely on telekinetic transport of our own bodies. Under our eyes are black markings, curving towards each other slightly. These prompted the humans to nickname us The Saddest Race just before our exile.

I never understood why.

Our planet is called Home; a lovely, quiet corner for us to live in. And this place was known as the Bubble Yard. I well remember my first day visiting it.

It had been decided that, as our graduation from the academy we had spent fourteen years in, we would spend an evening in the Bubble Yard. It was like a rite of passage because this was a place where lovers met.

I remember stepping into the bubble yard and immediately feeling uplifted. It was a beautiful place; the frequency of the electromagnetic field around it made the usually red sky look a blissful purple. It made me feel so good I had always been unpopular and I didnt expect to find love but even so this was a glorious place to be.

The bubbles started to appear from flaps in the ground and we soared up to meet them, each opening one up and entering. We flew and played all evening, having fun and laughing. Soon, some were merging their bubbles with people of the opposite sex, pledging their lives to each other. I was not one of these  originally.

Close to midnight most people were sharing bubbles. I was one of the exceptions. But suddenly I was approached by a female. Hey, she said. Youre Melanious, arent you?

I was totally in awe. Not only was I being approached by a female but it was none other than Perenara! She was one of the females that all the males adored, including me. I hadnt thought she had ever noticed me before.

Uh, yeah, thats me I felt flustered and unable to utter any more words than this.

Perenara giggled and said May I enter your bubble? She sounded nervous as she said it and I saw a side to her that no one had ever seen; the side that was insecure and which would even consider it possible that I should turn her down. I never would have, but this side of her made me fall in love with her even more.

I remember the next few moments as if they were yesterday and I treasure them so very dearly. Our bubbles merged and when we were both in one we gripped each other, sharing the telekinetic burden that we had. We put our foreheads together, our scent detectors connecting, and we performed a ritual similar to the one which humans call kissing. This, unfortunately, was another reason the humans exiled us. They heartlessly thought that this act of love was disgusting because it was conducted using our scent detectors.

We spent the rest of the evening together and another three years (which is five times longer than a human year). It was a perfect time, which I hoped would never end. But no perfection can be forever.

I remember the day the Universal Committee came to Home. They started attacking our people and I did not know why. I had been collecting crops at the time but I dropped them and rushed straight back home to find Perenara. The Universal Committee! They are attacking! We must go! I yelled, trying to pull her away.

Wait! she cried and floated over to a crib which held our new-born child, Chichida. I felt guilty for forgetting about him but I couldnt dwell on it; we had to go.

We left our house quickly but were confronted almost immediately by a human with a long item which I could not identify until it shot something hard and fast into my wife and child, killing them both.

I could not believe or understand this. All I could do was act in rage. I used my mind to lift the man up, bending his weapon in on itself. I started to compact his body, crushing it until all that was left was a mess of his disgusting, red blood and green clothing.

I looked down at my dead family. I hated what had happened to them, but I had to go, or the humans would catch me, too. So I floated away and vowed to return some day.

And so I did. It has been half a year and where the Bubble Yard, the place which I found my greatest happiness, was is now a great, metal building. Chemical smoke oozes from several chimneys, killing the atmosphere. I wonder what is being made in there. I dont really care but a part of me wants to know the justification for the death of my wife and son. The sight is too much for me; I turn away, tears starting to roll down my face and as I look into a pool of water and see my own reflection I realise why the humans called us the saddest race, for the tears follow the lines made by the black markings below my eyes.

OK, so this is my first time doing this. I would say be nice but, honestly, the harsher my work is ripped to shreds, the more I learn! This is a short story I wrote for my English coursework last year and it got a decent grade so I have often thought of extending it and making it a longer story. However, I always like to get critique on this kind of stuff because it all helps! Also, I just wanted to say that my word limit for this piece was 1000 words, so if it ever feels rushed or anything, that is why.
