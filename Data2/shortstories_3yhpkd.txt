He sits in the car. It's a trip he's made many times before, and at this point the route is second nature to him. Yet he still looks out the window, hoping the scenery might change. Thinking that it might fill the void that one too many tragedies has left in his soul. But it can not. Nothing can. 

His iPod has been playing for hours but he hasn't been paying attention to it since he first got into the car. The songs only seem to succeed in making him feel more hollow and alone anyway. Perhaps his lack of attention is for the best. 

He looks at the sky. 

It's a mix of colors, painted onto the atmosphere in a picturesque version of a borderline abstract life. Much the way he doesn't notice the music, he doesn't notice the inky blackness that seeps across the sky and into the explosion of colors that erupt as the sun sets and the stars begin to appear. 

Normally he would see it, but this time, he does not. Perhaps if he did he wouldn't feel so empty. Perhaps he would know how to go on. Perhaps it would lead him to think of an idea that would change the world and his life forever. 

Perhaps. 

He thinks about taking a picture of the sky to paint later. He thinks that it could be the best piece he's ever done. He thinks it could make his art career serious. Get him well known. He thinks about it for a long time. 

He's still thinking about it when the other car hits him. When someone who had the drive to actually take the picture stops paying attention to the road. 

He goes flying out the windshield. Didn't he have his seatbelt on before? He could swear he did but now he doesn't remember putting it on. 

He hits the pavement with a crunch, and before everything goes black he only has one thought 

"I never would have gotten around to painting it anyway"
