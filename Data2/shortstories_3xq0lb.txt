To BW: Caring, Safety, Treacherous

Chapter 3: Fear

It is an unstoppable force Losing someone I could always handle. Knowing that they are in a better place and that they are no longer in pain helps me to remember that where they are is now better than where they were. Someone leaving is a different story. I know they are somewhere else, I know they could be in a better place and I know they could be in a place that the situation is better than what it was. The problem with that is not knowing if they really are those things what if that person is in a worst situation and instead of letting someone in they refuse and you are no longer able to see what is really going on. Even if you try your best to reconnect with that person it might never be the same. Previous mistakes are too much to handle to keep it going and there is likely no option but to move on. One person has already taken the time out to do such a thing while the other person is sitting there still crying over the past mistakes and the five stages of grief are on constant repeat. Even if you try your best to make it up to a person that doesnt mean the person will try to do the same distance separates us but yet I am still waiting.

That ladies and gentlemen is fear 

Thanks for reading and as always IBW!
