After a busy Friday evening in Houghton, the night was finally drawing to a close. Most of the people had either thrown in the metaphorical towel and concluded to an early night, or had passed out in the corner of the White Lion pub, covered in their own spit and drowning in a culmination of their breakfast, half eaten lunch and a few litres of their favourite booze. 

&nbsp;

Three young men stumbled out the chipped wooden doors and into the street, trying their best not to step in the blood from the night's earlier fights. Broken bottles and pint glasses lay scattered across the floor. John's signature golden tooth glinting in the glow of the orange streetlights where it will stay until retrieved the next morning, only to be housed back in his mouth without so much as a rinse. The three men navigated their way through the debris and made their way toward the church, looking forward to retiring to their beds after another awful night of pulling. 

&nbsp;

They reached the church, all three not speaking a word in fear of opening their mouths and not being able to control whatever wanted to escape from the depths of their stomachs. Two of the men turned to face the other and gave a curt nod in his direction. Without any of the men breaking stride, the man broke off from the group and started heading in a different direction. Clearly his home was at the opposite end of the small town in which they all lived. Three became two. 

&nbsp;

The two remaining broke right and took a desirable shortcut through a dimly lit park, eager to return home as soon as possible. The shorter of the men, with elf-like ears and olive skin, spoke up. 

"CJ" he said, "Can I open up to you please?"

The other man, CJ, looked in his direction eager for the smaller man 
to go on.

"I've been struggling with this demon for a while" he continued, "I think it's time I finally accepted it. I'm gay" 
There was a brief pause in conversation while the shorter man collected his thoughts, "I hope this doesn't affect our..." 
The shorter man trailed off when he noticed that CJ had stopped and was now staring at him, wide eyed, in disgust.

&nbsp;

"You're fucking WHAT?" CJ growled. "You're no fucking friend of mine you fag cunt" 
"I bet you want to fuck me don't you? Stick your fag cock in my arse? Get all up inside my shitter? You should be ashamed of yourself" CJ ranted, "I hope you catch AIDS and fucking die. I can't fucking believe th-"
Within a second, CJ's tirade was over. The smaller man had lashed out at the back of his knee and knocked him to the ground. CJ's head had hit the ground and he was now laying unconscious on the floor.

&nbsp;

The short man panicked, he hadn't wanted to do that but he couldn't stop himself. He had battled with himself for too long, he couldn't face one of his so called friends shouting and screaming at him about it too. He crouched over the lifeless body and listened for a heartbeat. Tha-thump, Tha-thump, Tha-thump came the sound from CJ's chest. He was alive. The small man looked around, there was nobody in sight. The park was dark with only a few streetlights dotted around, there was no way anyone could have seen that, he thought. Maybe now is the time to fulfil the desire that he had been suppressing for so long. His hand slipped from CJ's chest down to the belt around his waist. Using both hands to loosen the buckle, he could feel his cock becoming more and more erect at the thought of what he was going to do. He ripped the belt out from under CJ and threw it aside. His hands now turned to the buttons on CJ's jeans. Delicately, he popped each button until they were wide open. The small man's cock now forcing itself against the inside of his pants, desperately trying to make some room. With Cum about to burst from the tip, he focused on steadying himself, he didn't want to ruin what was to come. 

&nbsp;

Slowly and purposefully, he pulled down CJ's jeans and boxer shorts. The short man stopped. Unable to behold what was before him.

Everyone has their demons
