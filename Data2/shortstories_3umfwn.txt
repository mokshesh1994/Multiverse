Please give feedback to this shortstory. This is my first shortstory that i share.


It is really beautiful. The sea. 

My mom told me we could have a fresh new start on the other side. She told me not to worry. We brought just enough money for the cheapest life-vest. My little sister only got the floating rings, the type you have around your arm. I have heard lots about people drowning in the sea, that some boats dont last very long. I wouldnt know what to do if that happened to me and my family, but I know, I always protect my little sister. 

Back home, every time there was a bomb, my littles sister, she would get so scared. She would call out to me Sister! and we both crawled under the bed, waited a couple of hours and came back out. We heard gunfire almost every day, so we got used to that. But we couldnt stay, we had to leave. Some of my friends had already left. At least the ones that are still alive. Some of their grandparents told me they got to Germany. That is where my family is planning to settle, so I hope Ill meet them there.

-	Come quickly! The boat has arrived, we are leaving shortly! My mom shouted.
-	Coming!
-	Dont take too long, or else the boat will leave without us and well never get to Germany! Find your little sister and lets move!
-	Ill be right there.

The boat was not as I expected. The rugged plastic probably couldnt last a day out there in the sea. There were about 40 other people there, putting on life-vests and changing clothes. At first I couldnt believe how 40 people would fit into one of those boats, but then it hit me. The boat owners want to save as many people as they can of course, so I shouldnt be greedy.

I helped little sister put on her life-rings. I just hope they can save her if she falls in the water. We all helped push the boat out into the water, and got into it one after the other. I went into the boat and carried my little sister with me. She was laughing. I could understand, since this is the first time she has ever been in a boat. I laughed a little with her.

The boat started running, the sound from the motor was like gunfire in my ears. I waved goodbye to land, as did my little sister.

It has been a couple of hours now. The clear dark sky is filled with bright stars as pure as silk. But we haven't arrived yet. It feels like we havent moved an inch. The sound from the motor is slowing down, until there is complete and utter silence. 

All of a sudden I can hear a bunch of questions from everyone in the boat, thrown out into the open.

-	What is happening?
-	Why did the motor stop?
-	Help!
-	Are we going to die?

My hands turn red and cheeks blue. The cold is like small needles piercing my skin. I hug my little sister and hold her tight, collecting as much warmth as I can, to try to warm her and myself. I look around us into the abyss of darkness. No one will come and save us. In this very moment I think back at all the things Ive been through. The bombing, the gunfire, my friends dying one after the other, and now this. I cant believe Im going to die here in this boat next to my beloved sister, whom I swore to protect. It cant end like this. No, not like this.

A flash of light blinds me. As I am blinded I see all the colors of the rainbow spinning around inside my eyelids. As the object in front of me slowly turns visible, two teardrops run down both sides of my cheeks and unite on my chin. 

We were saved. I grabbed the cold metal grip and walked up the stairs on the side of the boat. My sister was carried up right after me. 

We all got aluminum blankets and coffee, except me and my sister we got hot cocoa. I hugged my sister until she almost couldnt breathe. And told her;

-	We made it.

She looked at me like she could be traumatized for life. 

The sea. It is
