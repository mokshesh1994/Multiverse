I've spent the last decade professionally (well, academically, but I got paid for it so that counts, right?) helping figure out how humans became human, including the evolutionary origins of morality. When I saw this explainlikeIAmA question, "Explain why murder is bad like I'm a member of an extraterrestrial species that has no concept of mortality", I got a little carried away and wrote a 2.5k word short story that traces the evolutionary origins of death, culture and morality from the perspective of a school teacher in said alien species.

I suspect some people would enjoy reading the story, but I came to the thread a few days late so no-one saw it. I got a recommendation from r/findareddit to post it here, so I'm giving it a go.

Here's the story:
