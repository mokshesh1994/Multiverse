This is not suppose to be a sad/happy story. Just a fact actually.
All of my previous relationships became a 'thing' on a December.
Probably just a strange coincidence but whatever.
Statically speaking, it was gonna happen again right?
That in mind, I decided to write 'her' a letter in advance (Yes. I am aware that all letters are written in advance. Do not be a dick. Go with it).
Thought it would be funny to see 'her' react to it (and hopefully not break up with me then and there haha).
[3 MONTHS AGO]
Bought a card. Filled it. Bought a stamp. Mailed it (to myself of course).
I do not remember what I wrote but the gist of it is;
You must be my new girlfriend // I knew this would happen // LOL Do not break up with me
[3 MONTHS LATER]
The date is December 31st, New Year's Eve.
What do I do with this letter now?
