This is my first time being published and it's an incredible feeling. However, I want to promote everyone in the issue rather than just myself, so I'm not telling which piece is mine. I was a huge fan of this journal before they accepted my piece because they take chances on interesting, experimental, and fun works. It's online, it's free, and none of these take longer than ten minutes to read. Check it out, won't ya?
