Eyes open. 

Eyes shut. 

                     Blink. 

Eyes open. 

Eyes shut.
                  
                    Blink. 


Eyes open. Eyes shut. Eyes open. Eyes shut. Eyes open. 

Eyes shut. 

                     Sleep. 


Eyes open.  You can see her sitting at the end of your bed. Her matted black hair cascading down her back. You know she is going to turn around soon. You know she is going to turn around and it is going to be terrifying. Then her head starts to turn and suddenly your entire body is on fire. Your back is arching. Your throat is trying to force out a scream. It feels like this pain will never end. 

Then it stops. 

Youre lying on your back. You can feel the weight of the duvet on top of your chest and the pillow beneath your head. You try to move your arm. To wake up the person sleeping next to you but it just wont move. 
Turn the light on you say. 
Please just turn the light on. 
Why arent they awake? You were in so much pain; they must have heard you scream? You know she is still in the room but you cant move your head to look. 
Please. 
Please just turn the light on. 
It takes all of your energy to force these words from your swollen throat. All that escapes is a whisper. 

Eyes open. 

Its pitch black. You can move your arms again. You turn over to face the body sleeping next to you. 
Please. 
Please turn on the light you say. 
Their bleary eyes open. They didnt hear you at all. They had no idea how much pain you were in. You know you wont tell them what happened. You know you wont sleep with the lights off ever again.
