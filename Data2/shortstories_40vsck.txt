The war was not going well, after Normandy and Stalingrad I knew it was only matter of time. On the seventh of May that time came, my capital was sacked and He had shot himself, a far too merciful death. As my enemies looted my corpse I went some place I will never forget. It started as an empty field, like the ones in far off Dakota, but soon the dead came first by their hundreds then thousands, then millions. I saw the Jews, the gypsies, the homosexuals, all those whom I had considered unworthy, I saw the children, the men, the women, skeleton like with blank eyes and breathing zyklon b instead of air. I saw the citizens, burned in the bombings with flesh melting from their faces, starving because all the food went to the soldiers, and some killed for the simple crime of doubting my authority. I saw the soldiers, oh the soldiers, dead from a million bullets, blown up so much that not even the loved ones in the photographs could recognize them, dead because I could not protect them. The dead starched for miles in every direction, all coming for me, to give me may just rewarded.

But then, hope, I was no longer in that place, I was back home, watching stunned as my former enemies try to put me back together. It took years but I was finally back on my feet, a different man then before. Now, seventy years later I am surrounded by friends and happy with what I have built. Throughout the world others are making the same mistakes I did. I cannot stop them, however it pains me to watch. Instead I do what I can to help their victims and hope that they will learn from their mistakes, as I did. Every day I get up and remember that land of the dead, and every day I think the same thing. Never again.
