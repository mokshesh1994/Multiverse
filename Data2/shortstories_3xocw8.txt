###The lifeless monster 

The lifeless monster cannot die

It cannot wonder, cannot ask why

It feels not sadness, joy or love

The monster never cries



It met a child, the cold dark thing

A small lost girl, beneath it's wing

She sat and wept, in dark-filled night

So the beast did learn to sing



It hummed a low and warming song

That seemed to right just every wrong

And so the girl did wipe her tears

And sing and dance along



She brought it home and gave a bed

She showed it warmth and saw it fed

In return it hummed and hummed

While the villagers shook heads



The girl did grow and find a man

They raised a family hand in hand

The monster sang for all them

And together they did stand



And all the times they shared were good

Despite the odd looks, there they stood

Loved each other, for all time

Just as a family should



And so the years did come and go

With warm summer and cold snow

Where once a little girl did sit

Now a woman with her glow



At last even that girl did die

Left this world for another life

And so the lifeless monster cried

And cried and cried and cried
