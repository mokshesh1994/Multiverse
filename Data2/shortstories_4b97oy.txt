He was lying there. 6 meters from me. He had a creature that couldn't stop glancing at me. A small fragment of my soul desired to have the same creature.


Another moment I can remember is him walking away. Creature is following him. "Don't go" I please in my minds. It stopped. Turned around. Came to me. Everything goes dark. "Wish carefully"  once said my grandma. 


I can hear blood running in my vessels.  My heart is beating so fast that I can even feel vibrations in my chest.  I can feel all my synapses happening in my brain. I can clearly  hear my own breathing. I feel everything since the day when creature came to me. All I see is blackness, though.


Eyes appeared in that blackness one morning. They were staring at me and never left me alone. Have I wanted them to leave?


Sometimes creatures abandon you. Sometimes someone helps them to abandon you. Usually they just do. Maybe they find new being be with. Maybe they think that you learned your lessons. Maybe they forget. Maybe they are called by someone else.

My creature will never abandon me. I feel it in my eyes. And I can feel everything. I love my creature.
