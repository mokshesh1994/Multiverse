The dog was three years old when I got her. Cropped ears and a docked tail, sagging teats from a litter. She was standoffish in the beginning. Slow to trust. Our first 24 hours involved nothing more than being in the same room and no sudden moves. 

She was born to hunt; would run until exhaustion. Nothing I could say, scream or demand would bring her back. She would run her pray down or gasp for air as I caught up. That was her downfall.  Too focused on the coon she didn't smell the grizzly, didn't see the cubs. She saw them by the end. By the time I got there she was still. I buried her in the forrest. She was the best dog I ever had.
