I taste the sweet smooth buttercream frosting of my wedding cake, traveling to the joyous moment of unity and ecstasy embodied in the towered decadence of our love. 

I taste sweat as it rolls between my  lips in the heat of passion, it's salty musk belies the lustful actions of a forbidden love. 
 
I taste the bitter pill of iron as I lay fighting to stay in this life, reminded of the steel that shown ominously in the moonlight before my first love pulled the trigger. 

The final transaction completes. Iron, reminding me of the strength I will need to journey on from this life.
