It was over. For months he'd sat uncomfortably; his attempts at patience and finding tranquility were both flighty and short-lived. Waking hours rotated between blank gazes at the cold ceiling and darting looks into his rust-speckled mirror - both equally unforgiving hobbies. What possessions still existed were intentionally out of sight. A dull ache squeezed deep into his gut whenever he regretfully grabbed at them: just two photos and a magazine. 

"Why?" The question would haunt him from the moment he first asked. It crawled up and down his skin, suffocating his mind whenever it attempted to wander. It sat right in front of him and stared silently. It refused to leave.

Hearing two raps at his door he popped upright, the edges of his mouth gently turning upward as a man looked in with solemn eyes. He obediently followed him down a hall into a large, bright room and calmly walked towards the seat reserved for him. Forty fiery eyes pierced him as he sat, tears streaming down many. 

Two men strapped him in place while a third buckled the metal saucer to his head. "Any final words you'd like to say to the victim's family?" one man recited.

His throat swelled as he struggled to remember what he'd prepared. Between sobs he stammered, "Please, don't let me die!" to the crowd of disgusted onlookers. One guard nodded to another, and the moment was finally here.
