When i was younger, I used to feel sometimes like there was this ball of energy in one my hands. A ball I could actually feel. It was like it was giving off this glow pulsating in my hand. I could toss it back in forth in my hands like it was real.

I don't feel it now but I know I have that ball of energy in me. Maybe it's become my soul. Or it could be lost in my old childroom room somewhere.
