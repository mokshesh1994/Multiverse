I originally wrote this as a response to a /r/WritingPrompts prompt:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3vf40q/wp_a_video_game_developer_accidentally_creates/

However, the finished piece ended up being over 8-9 pages long, so I transferred it to a Google Docs, but I wanted credit of the prompt to be given where it's due.

Thank you /u/AinTunez for giving me a great prompt to write about.
