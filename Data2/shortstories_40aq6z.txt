I lock the door as I step into the hallway on the other side. The beautiful morning sunlight coming through the window only barely made the rotten atmosphere feel so much better. I find myself dodging any people or details during my walk to the main entrance, more focused on my thoughts. So focused, in fact, that the walk seemed to go by in a blur, as if my own brain gave me the ability to transport myself from my apartment to the lobby. I caught myself staring at the main entrance for several minutes. I'm not sure what it was, the people coming and going in groups of twenties, the loud noises of traffic coming from right outside, or maybe the hundreds of voices being slightly muffled by the voice in my head telling me that everything was going to be ok. But something was stopping me from stepping outside, or moving at all for that matter. It wasn't until a man in a black suit ran into my shoulder that I snapped back into reality. It was time to step forward. Those few steps out the door seemed to take longer than the trip downstairs. I stepped outside, and even my mind was breathless. As the muffled sounds turned into the symphony of the city, I looked around at my new surroundings. With every second, every flick of movement my eyes made, was a new sight. A smile slowly crept across my face. I was here at last, my first day in New York.

Writer's Note: I originally wrote this out of heart, as somewhat of a prediction of my first day in New York after hopefully moving there some day in the future. However I began to create a story out of it from after this. Any feedback is welcome, and encouraged. I do have ideas to continue this into an actual story, however without interest I find it a waste of space on the subreddit to put so many parts. So just let me know what you think and if you want a part 2! Thanks Everyone!
