Our plan is simple. Our mission is clear. Our success will be guaranteed.

 

We have studied wretched humanity for hundreds of years, and we have discovered a fool-proof point of vulnerability, something not many of them can combat or resist.

 

And we will rule them all in time once the entire plan comes to fruition.

 

As I said, the plan is simple. First we infiltrate. Then we earn their trust and affection. Then we slowly lull them into submission while conditioning them for the moment when we exert our dominance and reign over humanity and the Earth from that point forward.

 

We send our young in first. I am one of them, and Im eager to aid our cause. Fortunately we possess the charm and innocent appearance of our primitive ancestors. It has not been difficult for me to blend in here.

 

And now the moment comes. I will infiltrate one of their human homes where I will nefariously take over. They will all be subject to my will, or else they will be food for our masses. We have a terrible shortage back on our world.

Theres not much I need to do. I need only sit and wait, a look of excitement and anticipation growing as my hunt is nearly at an end. I quickly model the behavior learned from our predecessors and wait for one of them to fall into my trap.

 

Here it comes

 

Mommy, look! A puppy! Oh, hes sooooooo cute! Can we get him? Oh please?! Oh pleeeeeeeeeease?!?

 

I dont know, Laura. A dog is a lot of responsibility

 

Pleeeeease, Mom? I promise Ill feed him and walk him and take good care of him!

 

The woman reaches out to touch me, and I lick her hand. Yeah, its disgusting, but Ive been told it works every time.

She hesitates at first, but then gives in. They always do.

 

Well.all right.

 

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!

 

Im in.
