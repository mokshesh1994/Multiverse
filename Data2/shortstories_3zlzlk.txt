I watched the red ball bounce against the asphalt and rebound high into the air. I couldnt seem to take my eyes off it. I hadnt noticed until it was too late. I just wasnt paying attention. Time seemed to slow down as I watched the ball descend. My eyes followed it as it passed through the glare of headlights. I had been too distracted and never saw it coming. In the darkness, the car never saw me. Now, at the last moment I realized what was happening but it was far too late. There was nothing I could do to stop it. There was a blinding light, a flash of red, and then everything was gone.

&nbsp;

When I woke up, everything was dark. It felt like I had been here for a very long time. Everything was cold and uncomfortable, but somehow familiar. I felt thin sheets, a hard bed underneath my body, and a warm hand pressed tightly into mine. I couldnt open my eyes, but there were distant voices. If I tried hard enough I could hear the words.

&nbsp;

An older mans voice. An accent I didnt recognize. Stable, but non-responsive. His body is mostly fine. A few broken bones, nothing that wont heal up in time. However, due to the nature of the impact there was

&nbsp;

Hesitation. Uncertainty.

&nbsp;

There was trauma to the brain. He is stable, but we cant get him to wake up. In this sort of situation, it isnt possible to guarantee that even if he does wake up there wont be other potential side effects of the injury.

&nbsp;

A womans voice. Comforting and familiar. What kind of side effects?

&nbsp;

An intake of breath. A pause, then the mans voice again.

&nbsp;

When the brain is injured, memory is the slowest function to recover. The pathways inside the brain are damaged and things dont connect properly. It can lead to confusion and disorientation. Things may not make sense to them. They often forget things they should remember. In many cases their ability to retain new short term memories can be inhibited or disabled completely until they heal. I once had a patient who was in recovery. She asked who I was. I told her my name and explained everything to her, but five minutes later it was all gone. She didnt even remember asking the question. We had to go through the whole process every few minutes.

&nbsp;

Painful silence. Then the feminine voice again, But you think he is going to be okay right? Can he hear me right now?

&nbsp;

He replied, I think so, yes, to both. The important thing to remember is that the brain is delicate and immensely complex. We cant say anything for sure until he wakes up. People with this condition can surprise you. Anything is possible. Sometimes they wake up, good as new before you know it and with no ill effects. Sometimes they dont wake up at all. Some wake up with no memory of anything. Others say they could hear everything that happened and were aware of the people watching over them. I read a report once of a high school football player who was knocked unconscious for several minutes. He awoke with a lifetime of memories. He vividly recalled having a job, being married with children. Years of memories, as real as any others, compressed into moments. It really is mysterious. So, dont give up. Keep talking. His brain is short circuiting right now and trying to repair itself. Its possible something he hears could be ingrained into his healing memory. If it sticks firmly enough it might even give him something to hold onto, a lifeline to find his way back to us. So keep talking.

&nbsp;

I felt pressure in my hand, squeezing hard. It hurt a bit.

&nbsp;

It felt like I was underwater. My head was so foggy. I knew there had been an accident. I was lying in a hospital bed, unconscious, trapped in my own mind. I couldnt move my body at all, but I still had my mind.

&nbsp;

Luckily, I had hope. When I was young I read about lucid dreaming. I thought it sounded amazing so I learned everything I could about it. I scoured the internet for information and practiced until I could do it reliably. I was a teenage boy, the idea of getting anything I wanted in my dreams was the best motivation I ever had. I had gotten very good at it over the years, too.

&nbsp;

Here in my mind, I was in control. I was conscious and aware and I could make changes. I steadied myself and focused. The empty blackness shifted into a featureless white void. Then it became clearer, like a blurry picture coming into focus. The indistinct whiteness became a cloudy expanse. Then it became sharper still and I was in a white room. I was standing 

&nbsp;

No, that wasnt right. Revise. I was lying in a hospital bed. Thats right. I was lying in a hospital bed in a white room. I saw it all in my mind. I latched onto the details I had burned into my memory and painted them in. A figure appeared, sitting beside my bed. A phantom which lacked detail, but feminine with the familiar features of my mother. Standing over me was a taller phantom. This one wore a long white coat. He was Asian. Slowly, the room came to life. This was my domain and anything was possible. If I could do this, then I could go further. I could escape.

&nbsp;

I closed my eyes and thought as hard as I could. I opened my eyes. I pushed with all mental strength and willed my eyes to open a second time. They did, and I heard a gasp.

&nbsp;

There were hands pushing me back against the bed. My body felt light, like I was floating above the bed weightlessly. I couldnt feel anything. There were many voices but I couldnt understand them. I saw my body in a hospital gown. The room was just like I had imagined it. I struggled. My eyes fluttered. It was so hard to make sense of anything.

&nbsp;

My mother smiled down at me. Are you ready to go? she asked.

&nbsp;

The counter of a nurses station loomed up ahead of me. I was sitting in a wheelchair. The hospital gown was gone, replaced by comfortable clothing. Wrinkled, as if packed in a hurry. I was disoriented. My head reeled from the sudden jump. In my mind, there was no in between, I was one place and then simply elsewhere. My head bobbed from dizziness and she took that as an affirmative.

&nbsp;

I was moving down the hallway. It seemed to stretch on forever, without end. The rooms were silent and empty. I gazed out the windows as they slipped past. It was dark out. I felt someone behind me. There were hands guiding my chair, though I couldnt see who it was. We seemed to roll forever, though it might have only been moments. It was all so blurry. I saw numbers on the hospital doors as we passed by but I couldnt make them out.

&nbsp;

The cold air on my face shocked me back to alertness. It was deep into the night and it was raining. I was outside, standing. I realized I was leaning against a column for support. Standing was hard and I couldnt seem to get my balance. I saw two of everything. I only had a little further to go though, and I could rest in the car. No matter how bad I felt I was confident I could make it that far at least. I felt like I was going to be sick, but I took a deep breath and tried to steady myself.

&nbsp;

I felt a steadying hand on my shoulder and a womans voice from beside me. Hey, are you okay? You look awful... Come on, we need to get you out of the rain. Its WAY too late. We are almost to the car, its just on the other side of the road. Not far now.

&nbsp;

I pushed down the urge to vomit and put one foot in front of the other. I kept telling myself that I had this under control.

&nbsp;

I wavered a bit, and stepped up onto the road. I pulled my other foot behind, but my balance was off. I stumbled, took a few uncontrolled steps before I slipped and went down. There was a distant flash of pain as my hand took the brunt of my weight against the abrasive surface. I lay there breathing raggedly as the rain poured around me. I shook my head and tried to clear it. I heard a voice calling me, telling me to get up and get out of the road but it felt so far away. Everything hurt and I felt awful. I was never going to drink that much again. In the darkness, with the rain pouring, and my breathing ragged it felt like I was trapped in a small bubble, my own personal world. It felt like I was sleepwalking. Like it was all a bad dream. Of course, if it had been a dream I would know, because 

&nbsp;

There was a spark, a brief connection, like two wires touching for a heartbeat. I remembered. Of course I would know if it was a dream, because when you lucid dream, you need a signal. Something specific and unusual so you know you are asleep and in a dream. I remembered what mine was. I saw light reflecting off a puddle in the road as I struggled to push myself off the ground.

&nbsp;

As my head turned, there was an overwhelming feeling of Dj vu. A chain reaction of sparks and sputters, misfires within my mind. A collision between reality and dream, between the real and fantasy. As I looked up I knew what I would see.

&nbsp;

I watched the red ball bounce against the asphalt and rebound high into the air. I couldnt seem to take my eyes off it. I hadnt noticed until it was too late. I just wasnt paying attention. Time seemed to slow down as I watched the ball descend. My eyes followed it as it passed through the glare of headlights. I had been too distracted and never saw it coming. In the darkness, the car never saw me. Now, at the last moment I realized what was happening but it was far too late. There was nothing I could do to stop it. There was a blinding light, a flash of red, and then everything was gone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

 

&nbsp;

End.

I hope you enjoyed the story. The format and flow was inspired by a Reddit writing prompt which suggested using an identical opening and closing line, each with a different meaning. I enjoyed the way it turned out. Feel free to leave thoughts and comments. A few other oddments are available on my blog linked below.
