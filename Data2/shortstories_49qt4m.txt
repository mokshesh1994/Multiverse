Marcos mother, Isabella Carlitti, believed she had inherited genes from the French who had governed the area a hundred years earlier and had intermarried with the locals. Marco also managed to acquire genes from ancestors who had long ago either conquered the region or who where brought there as slaves. In addition to the French residents, Greeks, people from the land which would become Poland, and others who came from the north of Italy all had at one point in time lived in Bari. Marco had a lighter and more refined appearance than the local boys. The blend of nationalities mixed with the strong dimpled chins and wide smiles of the Italians combined in just the right way to give Marco a very compelling look which he used to his every advantage. Isabella turned a blind eye to her sons foibles as she too was taken in by her beautiful golden boy so that she could not place blame upon her youngest child for any of the trouble which he created. He was so different from her other children, all of whom looked like her husband who had dark brown hair, olive skin and the strong and angular facial features of the people of Bari. Marcos appearance was very close to his mothers, which was something that bonded her to her youngest child was.
