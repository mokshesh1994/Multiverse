The sea is something to admire from a distance so they tell us. I watch from a fence on a hill about 50 feet away. Images surround me of what lies below. Creatures that can breathe underwater and die on land. Sounds more like aliens than something we eat. The sun shimmers across it, guards standing around. Nobody really knows the origin of the job to protect the ocean. Nobody really questions it.

One day I find a guard just off from his position. A hole in the fence. The cameras will catch me but I have enough time to run and see for myself the creatures alive that lay underneath and not just cooked beyond recognition. I take speed and alarms go off around me. A few gunshots go off, whether they were warning shots I don't know the sirens drown out anything around me. I get closer and closer as the guards gain on me. Until finally..

I look into the depths of an empty blue void. I lean down and touch the surface. It electrocutes me. My hand spasms back in shock as the guards grab me and inject me with something that makes me fall asleep.

I wake up in a cell surrounded by other prisoners. The institution is not a normal holding cell, more of a place to keep secrets by the "higher" ones. I realise I won't be leaving this place. Whatever food they claim to serve us from the deep below isn't what they claim. The fact a whole society believes something can live underwater is baffling enough, but to think not everyone questions it is somehow worse.
 
The food is probably to control us or keep us relaxed enough not to check it out. Some of us are immune. Tests will go on here to find something that can affect us just as well as the ones who aren't immune.

Log entry #3 out... Not that anyone will get this.. At least number 1 and 2 should.
