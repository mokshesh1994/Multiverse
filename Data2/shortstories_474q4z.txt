Munjo, the name most people refer to as our planets is not spherical as most of the firmaments in the famous Milky Way Galaxy, but it is a disc, from the top it does look like a circle. But its still a disc-shape planet, one of many kinds in the Nenjuu galaxy. I love things that have the ability to die. The inhabitants of Munjo are said to be immortal, some believe its because of our dead planet's curse, a planet that survived the atrx1 decay wave that swept through most of the galaxies surrounding nenjuu.
