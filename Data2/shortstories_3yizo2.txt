I love good stories. Here are some of the shortest I was able to find. Impressive how simple you can trigger emotions and thoughts!

1. Goodbye mission control. Thanks for trying.

2. For sale, baby shoes. Never worn.

3. Introduced myself to mother again today.

4. Strangers. Friends. Best Friends. Lovers. Strangers.

5. The smallest coffins are the heaviest.

6. Yoyager still transmitted, but Earth didn't.

7. An only son, a folded flag.

8. I met my soulmate. She didn't.

9. I just saw my reflection blink.

10. Ever seen chalk outlines that small?
