Shadow of the Willow

A white-haired young woman and a boy sit side-by-side on the bank of a pond, gazing at the blue eyes of the pale-scaled fish flitting just underneath the surface.  The boy's brown eyes follow one of them as it darts towards the willow in the middle of the pond. It disappears into the shadows of the willow's branches.  The boy's fingers curl, gripping the earth.  He turns his head to the woman.

"Why do these fish look like they do?"

The white-haired woman does not respond. Her eyes continue to follow the fish.  She breathes in, and breathes out. The ripples of the pond lap quietly against the shore. "They have spent too much time in the light of the willow." The woman continues to watch the fish. The two sit in silence.

The woman turns to the boy. Her hair swings away from her face, and the boy glimpses the darkness where her right eye should be before her hair swings back to cover it.


"Do you know about the creatures that live in the pond?"


The boy nods. "The fish, the tree, and the plants."


"There are two other creatures that live in the pond, in the water. One of them is--" the woman extends her arm, and points a finger to the willow in the middle of the pond "--there."


"I already said the tree."


"I was not talking about the tree."


The boy follows the woman's pale finger.


"The shadow? It lives in the shadow of the tree?"


"No. It is the shadow of the tree."


"What?"


"The other creature lives in harmony with the shadow, and produces light."


"How can a creature be a shadow? How can something live in harmony with a shadow?"


The woman continues on.  "The fish in the pond look the way they do because they looked upon a creature of light.  While they were mesmerized by its light, the creature of darkness took their color, and an eye, and shares its new food with the creature of light as payment.  Both the creature of light and the creature of dark live in harmony."


"What if something looks on the creature of light and the creature of dark has already taken an eye? 


The woman's eye turns downward.


"The darkness will consume them."


"It eats them?"


"No. They become the darkness."


"I don't understand."


Do you know why I always fish in the same place, even though I never catch anything to eat?


The boy cocks his head. Why?


The woman lifts her chin, and gazes at the blue, cloudless sky.  My husband, daughter, and I used to come here to fish together.  We would always spend our afternoons here, listening to the earth and its creatures.


The boy stares intently at the woman. I didnt know that you had a family.  Where are they?


The woman does not answer, and simply stares at the shadow of the willow.

Not another word is spoken for the rest of the afternoon until the sun shines red upon the surface of the pond. The woman lifts her head up, and turns to the boy.  You should return home, child.  Your parents will begin to worry about you if youre not home before dark.


The boy stands up, and stretches.  Youre right.  Ill see you tomorrow, wont I?


The woman nods, and the boy hefts his fish pole over his shoulder, and walks away.

The woman stares into the pond with the light of her lantern.  She remembers a handsome man, and a smiling young girl, and blinks again as her vision blurs with tears.  A cloud of darkness emanates from the shadow of the tree, billowing across the ponds surface, and enters the ring of light.


The solitary blue eye blinks once more. Her hand stretches out.


I want to see them again. She whispers to herself, and her fingertips brush the black.

The boy's lantern-light bobs in the dark as he navigates his way home, his feet softly plodding on the earth, grass crunching underfoot.  He began to whistle a little tune, enjoying himself as he walks home.  He wonders what will be for dinner.  The hairs on the boys neck stand up suddenly, and he senses another presence nearby.

 
The boy brandishes the lantern. "Who's there?"


There is no response. A silhouette in the shape of a leg and foot extends into the lantern's ring of light, and then another leg follows suit. The black feet shuffle silently across the lantern-light.


"Hello?"


A pitch-black hand swings forward alongside the leg, fingers outstretched. The boy reaches for them, and he grabs hold of the hand.


Darkness.


The boy feels his eyes open, yet he sees nothing, hears nothing, and feels nothing.  Neither heat, nor cold, nor pressure, nor the song of the birds nor the ever-present hum of life.


"Why did you touch me, child?"


A thought emanates from everywhere, both outside and inside the boys body, but it has no sound, and no voice.  Yet the boy hears it, thinks it, and feels it.


"Where are you? Who are you?" He cries out.


A vibration begins in the boy's body, but there is no sound. 


You should not have come here.


The vibration gradually increases in force, and a creature of light glides overhead.  Its serpentine body shines a bright white and tendrils of light extend away from the body, splitting into beautiful branches of light.  The head turns, and then descends in front of the boy, close to him.  The boy shuts one eye and squints with the other, trying to block out the blinding light.  Overhead, the shining, feathery tail of the creature finally comes into view.  The creature's head continues to descend into the darkness, spiraling silently away from the child.  Tendrils of light float weightlessly, and finally the tail passes the child, following the rest of the body into a spiral.  The boy's open eye follows the spiraling body until it is only a bright dot in black space and then it disappears.

The boy sits upright with a jolt, opening both eyes.  But he only sees out of one.  The boy jumps to his feet, and stumbles and trips his way up to the willow pond.  The boy stumbles and falls to his stomach on the bank of the pond, his eyes shut in pain.  When he opens his eyes and looks into his reflection, one blue eye returns his gaze.  A pure black hole covers the place where his other eye should be, and white hair frames his face.

The next day, the boy returns to the pond, sits on the bank, and casts his line.  He sits in wait for the white-haired woman.
