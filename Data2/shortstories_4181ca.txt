I'm standing on the edge of the cliff overlooking the sea, the rose in my hand. The one with the black ribbon on it. He gave it to me at the ball.

It was a grandiose masquerade, and we danced the night away in each other's arms. We interlocked fingers and ran out to the gardens, with the moon smiling over us. He pulled me against him and we leaned against the sweet smelling magnolia tree. We were away from the noise, and all worries were long gone. He looked into my eyes as if he could see the bottom of the ocean. He leaned down to kiss me and my head began to spin. And spin, and spin, and spin...

The winter wind whipped around me, my dress moved with every gust. I raised my hand with the rose, and let it drift away. It fluttered in the air for a moment, then slowly made it's way down to the waves below. The tears were the only sign of emotion I could betray. His memory is finally at rest. I turn back to the home we once shared. The sky above seemed to share in my bleak outlook and hollowness. But I had a reason to continue on: our son that shared his face. 

I entered into the small cottage to have my ears ringing from my son's screaming. Poor thing had colic again. My mother-in-law was doing her best to calm the child, to no avail. I slowly trudged upstairs to the loft for a moment's rest. The room was too large now, for just myself. The bed was cold and damp, and the window covered in frost. The cradle was old and rank, but appeared quaint with the christening blankets for my son. Our son. 

Shivering, I crawled under the covers and prayed. Prayed for our baby, prayed for the pain to end, prayed so I could start breathing again.
