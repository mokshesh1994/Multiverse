What do you hear? 

Silence. Silence so dense its pressure in my chest.  
Then a beautiful melody. Like a spring rain and the smell of sweet fresh grass. The violin warms up the silence as its tones ring through my ears. The piano eagerly joins it. Intertwining their soft fingers and hinting at a romance. A romance so strong it leaves bumps against my skin, exhilaration just pulling at the surface and waiting to escape. 

There is no waver as the violin disappears and the piano sings its soulful song. It tells me to become lost in a place far away from reality, where thoughts flow as freely as the notes from the string instrument as it chimes in again. 

Back and forth, they call to each other. Sometimes one without the other. One just as soulful, with or without its partner. They yearn for each other and arent complete until the other joins them, just as smoothly. 

They tell a beautiful story of intimacy. The piano holds its own chords with a sense of strength. The violin adds its string song in harmony, singing a song of beauty. 

Highs and lows and the deep tones are silk, something so precious and lovely while soft to the touch. 

Their fade into the distance is sunset red. Breathtaking and inspiring in the same thought. The light touches every corner of the horizon before disappearing into the silence again.

A little background: I used to write constantly. Life caught up and I've had a few years away from what I loved to do. Words are my expression. This might not be the best "short story" or whatever you want to call it, but it's a start. Feedback is always appreciated.
