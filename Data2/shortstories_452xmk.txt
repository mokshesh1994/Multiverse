Slithering, and creeping, in the dark they came. Whether marching side by side, or crawling over each other, inexorably, unstoppable they came. When it was quiet, and the moon touched the sky, they came out to play. They tore, and ripped. They destroyed, and infected. Where once was good, the bad things came, and tainted and twisted all they touched.

I'd fought for so long. Held my walls strong, and my defenses solid. In the dark they came, and battered and bashed, and still I held. I'd almost given up hope, then I found a light. I finally had a light in the darkness, a beacon that gave me hope. The light shown, and the darkness could not comprehend it, but they feared it, and it was held at bay.

But then a darkness rose in me. Keeping the dark at bay for so long, alone, it had finally got a tendril into my heart. It grew and grew, until finally, it burst through me, and all of my walls, and drove me me mad. And in that madness I lashed out at all around me, and drove the light away. Slowly, over weeks, I picked up the pieces of myself, and rebuilt my walls, but the light would not come back, because she had been scared.

Now I'm to face the dark alone again, knowing I once had the light and betrayed it and lost it forever. I don't think I'm strong enough anymore. I can't face it alone, having once had a light to shine through it with me.

When the dark comes for me next, I think I'll welcome it finally, and be done of this fight forever. Oblivion would be a better option than yearning for the light that won't come back.
