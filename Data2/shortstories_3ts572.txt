Maybe one day you will get to live my life. See everything I have. From the breathtaking canyons to the most emptiest nights. When you get to my highlights I will envy you. When you seek refuge from the rain I still would. Of every life I ever lived this is the one I want to have nightmares of. This is the one I won't forget from now until eternity. Every word I speak you would have too. My fears I want back. My rejections too. I want de ja vu. Take me back to when I could play any song I heard. When I have your life I promise I will find you. Guide you. Show you how to live. But until that day, may the world take care of you. The beginning is the hardest part. And it is not that I grew up. I found you.
