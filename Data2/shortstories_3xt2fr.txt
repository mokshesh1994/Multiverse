The older man with the grey jacket shuffled a few papers and looked across his desk to the almost comically tall man who had taken off his beret to hold it nervously on his lap, his uncertain gaze pointed at the floor. Like a pupil who was at the headmaster's desk, the man who had introduced himself as Samuel Arvidson, a roofer from Tromso, Norway came with an appointment, after exchanging a few letters. Here he was in London at the Israeli Embassy a brisk September morning.

-I was told you are a Roofer Mr. Arvidson, how is business in Tromso ?

The tall Norwegian's cheeks reddened significantly, as if embarrassed, he smiled meekly and looked up at the man who was introduced to him as Michael Comay, the Israeli Ambassador to the UK. His smile broadened and he answered almost imperceptibly.

-A plumber ... Uh ... Sir

The Israeli adjusted his suit and his stare dug into Arvidson, whose squirmy demeanor mildly annoyed him. He thought that he was probably the highest form of government official Arvidson had ever encountered, and although he understood the uncertain english of the Norwegian plumber, he had a busy day and needed to 'get on with it'.

-Plumber, Roofer, these are two things I do not require Mr. Arvidson, you wrote us a few letters over the last few months, you embedded a sense of urgency in us meeting. I'm assuming that you have something you want to tell me. So what is it you need to tell me Mr. Arvidson that couldn't be communicated in your correspondence.

Arvidson's demeanor changed. His face darkened and he took in a deep breath.

-What I'm about to tell you might be difficult to understand but please know this sir, that I am not to be trifled with, I know for a fact you are not Ambassador Comay, probably an associate or a an agent of the Israeli government, please my information must be communicated to Mr. Comay, I will not tell anyone else.

The Israeli in the grey jacket paused. His hand reached in his pocket and removed a cigarette and lighter. Arvidson was not as stupid as he looked but he didn't have time to play any games.

-Mr Arvidson, Ambassador Comay is listening to this conversation via a communication device that taps our discussion to another room. There are security concerns that you cannot possibly understand at the moment. I will gladly listen to what you have to say but you should not waste our time any further and start talking

Arvidson bristled and got up, putting his beret back on his head, clearly indicating he was ready to leave.

-Maybe the American ambassador will be a more receptive ear, I am sorry you feel I have wasted your time, I should take my lea...

A Phone rang in the room. Both man stood still. The Israeli picked up the phone, after a few seconds he handed the phone to Arvidson who listened, and sat back down.

-There was a man in my town who wasn't who he claimed to be.

The Israeli took a long puff and waited quietly for Arvidson to continue.

-This man arrived in our town a few months back, he moved into an apartment down the hall from mine, the only thing I knew about this individual is that the mailman identified him to me as Robert Liebstein because of the bills. He was a quiet old man who kept to himself. He had few visitors and seemed like he was living off a wealthy pension of sorts. He had a very long beard and always wore a hat. A few days after moving, I was approached by a young man who told me he wanted to speak to me about work that needed to be done in Mr. Liebstein's apartment. The man came from out of town, spoke with a German accent and told me that I would need to replace a sink. That he would be there while the work was done, that Liebstein was an important man, a Rabbi, and that he didn't communicate with others because of what happened to him during the war. I accepted the task and showed up at Liebstein's apartment a week later, there was nothing unusual about the whole affair until I accidently dropped a bucket exiting the bathroom when I was done, I heard Liebstein say something in German, in an angry vicious voice, it was an insult. 
I exited the flat, careful and respectful, not saying a word, Liebstein just sat at a table facing the window the entire time. My father had fought with the Nazis during the war and ... well ... 

The Israeli, put the cigarette butt in the ashtray and lit a second one.

-Mr. Arvidson, I do not see where you are getting at. Is a Jew in Tromso that unusual ?

Arvidson took another deep breath and continued

-I decided to try to know a bit more about Robert Liebstein, I think that this is a guilt that most children of Nazis go through, I was genuinely curious about him but too shy. I wrote to Holocaust associations, one wrote back. I started a correspondence with a man called Simon Barchichat in Israel. He said he wanted to know if I could locate Liebstein's prisoner number, it would help him know in which camp he had been. 
So I took it upon myself to know as much as I could about what he had gone through. One day as he left his apartment I let myself in. There was absolutely nothing there. Just furniture, no books, no diaries, no letters, nothing with any information on it. I left and waited for him to return. I waited by the entrance of the building. When he arrived he was accompanied by three elder men I noticed that none of them had a number on their arms. They spoke German and acted like I didn't exist. I abandoned my quest into gathering more information until I received a letter from Barchichat. He told me that he had done some digging and forwarded a picture of Robert Liebstein when he was young, it was the only known picture of him. He also said that he found someone who knew him from his youth in Latvia and included a letter to Liebstein from his friend. I thought I'd surprise Liebstein, I kept the picture and the letter and thought of the right way of approaching him. A few days later my phone rang and it was Barchichat, It was the first time we spoke, he had tracked down my number and wanted to discuss Liebstein, he said the old friend found it strange that he would be in Norway and the more I discussed my observations with Barchichat, he started to suggest I should tread carefully as there were some suspicious elements to the story, the main thing that stood out, is that he said Liebstein shouldn't speak German, he was a Latvian Jew and spoke Russian and Latvian. He should be around 60 years old, but the Liebstein in Tromso was over 80 years old, I was sure of it.
One night I woke up in the middle of the night and I could hear him screaming from across the hall, something about it, the same viciousness to his voice, he was screaming in German. I heard the voice of the young man who had hired me for the job tell him to quiet down.
I started thinking that my Liebstein was a Nazi in hiding. This is when things started getting complicated. I decided to play dumb and put the letter from Liebstein's friend in his mailbox and see what would happen. 
The next day four men broke into my apartment while I was having dinner they held me to the floor with a gun on my temple while they went through my papers. They found the correspondence and started reading it. Liebstein entered and was screaming at the men in German They tied me up and interrogated me, asking me what I knew, if I worked for some secret services or government.

Arvidson paused and his voice started trembling.

-He came close to my face and I knew, I knew right there that this was not Liebstein. This was not the man from the picture. This was a man I knew, a face I knew from decades ago. 

He started crying.

-They all left the apartment except one man who whispered in my ear with the gun on my head, he said that I must pretend to be dead, that he would shoot a blank, he told me Liebstein would disappear and not to tell anyone what I had seen, I heard a gunshot and must have passed out from fear. I woke up and was untied it was like nothing had happened.

A door behind the Israeli agent's desk opened, it was hidden by the Library. Arvidson recognized the real Ambassador. He came in with a forced smile on his face. The Norwegian didn't say a word. Comay nudged the agent in the grey suit to leave the room.
He sat on the edge of the desk, sighed and spoke. Arvidson started sobbing.

-We appreciate you bringing this to our attention Mr. Arvidson, we would appreciate you not discussing this further from this moment on.

Arvidson looked up now, his eyes red.

-That man who shot the blank, his accent was like Barchichat's he was an Israeli, he was one of you, how could this be.

Comay got up and kneeled next to Arvidson.

-Good day Mr. Arvidson, talking will insure that the next bullet is not a blank

Arvidson froze, after a few minutes he slowly got up, his lanky 7 foot frame towering over Comay. He turned around and headed for the door. 

He heard Comay's tone rise

-Are we clear Mr. Arvidson?

As Arvidson exited the embassy he put his beret back on. He spent the next few hours wandering the streets of London, looking for refuge from his thoughts. A Norwegian poem came to him.

It's the dream we carry in secret

that something incredible can happen

that it must happen
