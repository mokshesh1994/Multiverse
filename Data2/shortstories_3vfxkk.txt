Everyone likes Susie and she likes to laugh she is so pretty and she knows that Paul is the quarterback he is the dream that Susie writes in her diary

She's read the magazines so she makes her move Paul plays her music and she gets in the mood

The moment is so perfect and Susie starts to cry that doesn't stop him and she doesn't wonder why

She knows it ain't what she's always wanted and the dream well it's always been in the magazines

Susie dresses in black she knows no one'll ask why she's acting so sad

Black fails to represent she may never wear white again

She gets home to her magazines and she burns her favorite little dreams she sees that beauty never lacks as the smoke turns the pages black

Her mom finds the therapeutic scene angry at her psychotic little teen "Susie, practice your cheers! You're the Homecoming Queen."

Susie watches tv instead as she floats on her bed she enters another dream the one where Joel is the lead

Joel is quiet and shy being lonely makes conversation dry then he meets Clementine

Susie loves to cry she really believes Joel changes his mind maybe someday she'll be a blue Clementine
