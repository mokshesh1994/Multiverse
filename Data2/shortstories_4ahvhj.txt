long ago, when the world was younger, and man was first starting his treacherous journey through time on this planet there was a great power that only humans possessed, it was the power of talent and all people possessed it, but it was not a power borne equal upon humanity, some where swift of foot, others strong of sight, or quick of mind. this is as it should have been, and as it still is in some respect, but some abused their talents given by this world.
Some hurt others, stole, cheated, killed, and worse some drove others to do this in their own names, for their own goals, and the world suffered. 
Long where these days of strife, men killed each other, nations were formed and crushed as day and night fell in cycle, and this too became the way of man, for a time.

But time changed as is its way, and people changed as is theirs.
and eventually four beings were born to the race of men. 
Four beings to save mankind from its folly.
They were known as the four supreme Kanyes of North,South,East and West, and with them was born a responsibility, a promise to the race of man. that they would protect the talent of others until a day when humanity could be trusted once more with its power.
And this too for a time was the way of the world, but human nature is not so fickle a thing as to be held at bay by a mere promise.

As the age came to a close the smallest of the kanyes, kanye west,
went on a Kanye Quest and rose up in rebellion against his brothers, and slew them by guile and treacherous means. one by one they fell before him and had their talent syphoned by him, until his thirst was sated at last.
Stronger now he proclaimed in his victory.
"I have become the Kanye Best"
and thought himself truly Kanye Blessed.
