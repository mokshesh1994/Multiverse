Hiding behind the gloomy shadow of the back of the bus and chewing on the straw of a lukewarm coke, I realised I was faced with a dilemma. The issue was that we hadnt seen each other in a while with much left unsaid, which made it all the more terrifying that you may have the steadier hand when it came to a bitter conversation.

The walls were beginning to feel wet. While the doors to the bus were still open, anybody else who had needed to leave had left swiftly and quietly, leaving another mans arm stuck to mine in the humid corner. My distance from the door seemed to be growing larger while you were approaching and diminishing my imaginary escape route. A lunge for the bell would have been futile. And so, there was no choice but to remain in my seat while you scanned your ticket, smiled gingerly at the driver and found a seat adjacent to me but three rows in front, opening - fidgeting - judging and closing things.

I wondered what music she was listening to, which led me to ponder how much anything could change in three months. Plugged in and detached, eluding my reflection in the screen in front. Mirrors couldnt hide her expression, it was one of vacancy and wonder, in your own music video. 

You knew I was there.
