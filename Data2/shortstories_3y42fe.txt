Everyone stared at me in horror as I placed my work on the desk. I turned and cleared my throat elegantly.

"What defines a fine poem one may ask. The stories and markings on ones skin can be put into many words. Words I find myself unfamiliar with. So, as promised, I did my assignment my way. A body has many flaws and I give you the opportunity to explore our biggest flaw. Here lies poetry for you all to read the markings."

NOT ONE PERSON CAME OVER!. I was furious. Here lies a dead girl who asked to be part of my project and NOT ONE PERSON comes to even look at her! "You are all a disgrace. Imagination is limitless and yet you look at me as if I am the one who is in the wrong? FINE, would it be okay if I change my assignment sir?"

Poetry had hand scalped lines across her body almost patternless. Yet something made me think that my craft work was not yet finished. Society has failed me. Imagination is limitless but some don't want to know.
