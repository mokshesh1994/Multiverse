I have been writing a small story that takes Batman into a different reality. This is my first story.

___________________________


Batman - Harley, Harley, Harley.... You didnt believe that you were the only one that was nuts, did you? I may not be normal, hell, I am as abnormal as anyone can possibly be... In-fact, I think I'm even crazier than you! And still you wonder... Who am I? HAHAHAHA WHO AM I?!?!?!? I am the darkness! HA! I am also the night!!!! Do you still not know who I am? I am not the goody two shoes that would just lock you up and throw away a key.... HAHAHA!!!!!! I am not going to send you to prison.... HA! I'm also not going to just let you go away quietly.... I know who the hell you are.... HARLEY!!!!! HAHAHA!!!!!!! But who the hell am I? I am pure justice, I am the guy who gets what he wants in the end.... and brings Gotham what it deserves! I... am... Batman!

Mrs. Normand - James, what are you doing to that poor dog? He looks gross, and old, get it out of here
___________________________
James Normand - Mom this is Alfred, you know that! Its not like you cook meals around here, clean the house or help me with my school work. How could you treat someone that works for you with that kinda disrespect?

Mrs. Normand - James! He is literally a dog! And dont say those things to me again!

James  - Whatever...


James Normand, a young minded 28 year old who has grown up in Gotham, has found himself trying to cope with the stresses of the all too real reality where vigilantes such as the Penguin, Scarecrow, Two face and their leader Harley Quinn run these streets....


TV - ATTN: Bruce Wayne, Gothams own self made millionaire has had another break in, fortunately for him authorities arrived just in time. This break in occurred 2 days after Mr. Wayne invested 400 million dollars into the whole chain of Club Gotham, putting Mr. Oswald Cobblepot out on the street. Authorities are leading into this investigation on Mr. Cobblepot which has been linked to a group of thugs called the Penguins...

Alfred - Sir, I trust that you know what you are going to do in this situation, I feel like the more information that spreads virally on Mr. Cobblepots down play, the more involved the public will be on the incident. Possibly putting their lives in danger.
___________________________
James Normand  - I have no idea how this could happen, no, what I really mean is... I cannot let this happen, I need a way to hide my identity from the public, instead of being Gothams' millionaire I need a second identity. I wish I had my mom and dad to talk to about this situation

Alfred - Sir, you know your parents would be right by your side for anything they always have, but the consequences became real that fateful day, God rest their souls...
