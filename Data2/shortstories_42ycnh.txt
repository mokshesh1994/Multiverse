A drop falls, tainted red with haemoglobin. One in the midst of countless other drops, followed by another one. 
I stood a few meters away, watching the drop fall in slow motion. A car with people inside, all like Faberg eggs, cracked open. Nothing left to hide.
A cat slipped away; it barely stayed alive. It was its fault. Ran in front of a car, full with compassionate souls, who instead ran into a light pole.
The lamp pole flickered, and died. I could almost see the souls rising as vapor, in the midst of countless suspended tears from heaven that were present.
