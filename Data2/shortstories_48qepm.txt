Fifty-one Years

We had talked about it for a long time. 

She wanted to be cremated. 

We had it all set up; I didn't even have to think. 

---------------------------------------------------

A couple of weeks later I received a small vial of her ashes in the mail. 

A pendant. 

I wore it as a necklace so she was always with me. 

I carried her for fifty-one years. 

That's when they went public. 

----------------------------------------------------------------


They had discovered how to reincarnate someone. 

All you needed was a piece of them, just a piece.

A flake of skin, a strand of hair. 

They were even able to do it from ash. 

I knew that I had to do it. She wouldn't have wanted it, but I had to be selfish. 

Fifty-one years alone, after having lost the one you love, especially so young, is a lot to go through. 

Fifty-one years had passed; I was fifty-one years older. 

She wouldn't be. She would still be twenty-seven. 

I knew she would leave me eventually, but I couldn't deprive the world of her. 

What a magnificent woman she was, really something else. 

She would be able to continue her life, right where she left off. 

She would continue to be exceptional. 

----------------------

I made the consultation appointment as soon as it was commercial. 

I was one of the first and most tragic, so they offered to rush the procedure for me in exchange for publicity. 

I, of course, agreed. 

It was still going to be a year before she was alive again. 

They took the whole vial of ash.

They said it works better that way.

----------------
My face started appearing on billboards, along with little snippets of my story. 

How sad, they said. 

A new life, they said. 

Another chance at young love gone too soon, they said.

Meanwhile, I waited.

Anticipation has a way of making you sedentary.

----------------------

Months passed before they came back to me.

I was a little bit of a celebrity by that point, but I ignored it as my excitement grew.

They called me to their building. They had an update for me.

I assumed that it was either going faster than they expected or slower.

I went in expecting nothing.

---------------

All you have here, they said.

All you have here are the ashes of her blouse.

Oh.

There is nothing we can do, they said.

Oh.

We've known since the first week, they said.

Oh.

We took that time to figure out what to do, they said.

Oh.

You see, we've sunk too much money into the ad campaign, they said.

Oh.

To have a failure now, no matter why, would be detrimental to the company, they said.

Oh.

We have found someone, a drifter, they said.

Oh.

You are aware of our other procedure? It involves selective amnesia and creating new memories, they said.

Fifty years, carrying her shirt around, I thought.

Yes, I said.

We have done that to this drifter. She is now, for all intents and purposes, your wife, they said.

Oh?

However, we cannot have you slipping up. You will undergo the procedure as well, they said.

Okay, I said.
