   I wake up at 3 am, listen to the rain leaking through the ground. It's a soft tinkling sound that is soothing like a wind chime on a lightly breezy day and somehow it makes me have to pee, yet i can't quite leave this wonderfully comfortable bed heated by the heart beat of the man i love. The urge becomes strong as i toss and turn trying desperately to ignore it but alas. I must deal with it, and swiftly. As i sway wearily into the cold bathroom, i am met with the eerie feeling that i am being watched, like someone is hanging over my shoulder, just behind my head regardless of how fast i spin. Relief is brief, as i drift back to my cave yet my weary eyes wont let me sleep as my restless mind reflects on the previous dream, or was it reality. The cool tiles beneath my feet, I could have sworn I was there...And yet the bed is damp.
