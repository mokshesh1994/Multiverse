If hope you guys enjoy! Feel free to make any recommendation or suggestions for Part II as well.
The purpose of Conexus is to be a short story that mixes mythology (druids, shapeshifters, giant beasts) with a criticism to our society as it is now, without giving much information, how there is a ever growing rift between humans and nature.

In Part I I focused mostly on the meeting. Part II will be about Conexus itself (man and wolf becoming one). All through the story you will find out why both of the main characters have a deep loath for society, the reasons behind it, along with a bunch of fantastic and epic moments that I hope I'm up to the challenge of write properly.

If you like Conexus Part I, you can follow me on Wordpress, Twitter or Medium to get the next parts of this epic story.
