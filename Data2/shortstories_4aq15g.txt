Hey guys, so I wanted to do a little short film and I've got a sort of  base idea. 

It's about a teenage P.I (Private Investigator) who dropped out of school at 16, does his job illegally, smokes weed and squats in an abandoned police station (which he's got his own office in where he does his work.) 

He got kicked out of his parents house and since then he's been running a business where he solves people's problems. I want it to start with him taking photos of an affair and meeting up with the guy to sell him the proof (pictures). 

I really don't know where I want it to go from there but it needs to be something different. For example he could get a case that's personal to him and it interferes with his current life. 

I was hoping I could get some feedback from the community and maybe include writing credits if I can get anything of interest.
