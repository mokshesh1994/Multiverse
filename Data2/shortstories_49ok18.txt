It was early Sunday morning. The sun was shining and the birds were chirping. She was there. I said, "Hello". No response. Wow. I was shocked. The day went on. Lunch time. No sign of her. Perfect. When I checked the mail, it hit me. Today is Sunday. No mail on Sunday's. Man, it was rough. I went to kick the mailbox, no legs. I forgot. When I thought I was at my house, I wake up in the hospital. Legs still gone. She is standing there. She hands me my medication... Numb.
