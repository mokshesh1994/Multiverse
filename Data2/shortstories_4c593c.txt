I was uncontrollably shivering as I kept a firm grip on my jacket. The snow was thick and the cold air thicker as every breath hurt my lungs. It was dark but not night just yet, though the weather was oblivious to this.

I see a darker patch of white, some dirt was visible. It was a cat with no collar lying in the snow with what appeared to be a fatal injury that caused its ribs to break. I look into the weary green eyes as it looks straight past me. Shaking, scared and alone I could see it there was no helping this cat. The winter is taking toll on me and for a brief second I was going to go. I cursed myself for even considering such thought and knelt beside this furry friend.

I was still uncontrollably shaking but took my jacket off anyway and put it around the cat. The cats eyes looked at me with what felt like an acknowlegement to a kind and selfless act. The cats white paw was reaching my way like they do to for attention, only this time it was for help. My hand shivering just as much held gently the reaching paw and I an emotional battle became upon me. I talked quietly to the cat as it listened intetively, both of us wishing we could understand one another. Its slight purr said more than words could. "You need to let yourself go" I cried as I couldn't bare this moment much longer. If the cat was hanging on for me I would hate myself.

A short exhale. Another shorter one. The eyes resting followed by a last purr. The cat had enough. I sat for what felt like an hour crying with my jacket still on the deseased cat. I took my time before I head home contemplating what it was I would hang on for.
