Suns rays penetrated the torn flag that laid peacefully over a stained window, the rays gave off a melancholic shade of blue that represented the Union Jack that once was. The room was something of a depressing nature, all personality that belonged to the room was now gone, the painted white walls, chipped away to reveal a disgusting underlay, the wooden flooring, rotted away, the door barely hanging on to the one rusted hinge, the remaining letters on the center of the door that once spelt a name that is no more; A E X D R. 

The room was stripped of all its basic furniture, all that was left was an oak coffee table with three legs and a cinderblock to support the weight of the items it held, these items included; 1 Fairbairn-Sykes knife, 1 General Service Respirator, 11 110 ml cans of red spray paint, 1 SIG-Sauer P226, 6 handgun magazines each full with 15 9x19mm bullets and 1 suppressor made to fit a handgun, a mirror standing upright against the table had a polaroid picture tucked into the top left of the frame concealing half of the photo. Below the photo showed a reflection of a grimy sleeping bag, it contained a figure.

I've only started writing this & i was wondering if i could get feedback on it, many thanks - Dik
