I've fallen into a Champaign drop. Became suspended in an amber night sky of tiny bubbles sparkling. As it super novas I hold on to a drop and sail away until I stop. There's no sky beneath, land above me, nor air around me. The universe begins to drown me.

I envision crystal ships floating on a sea of bland people hovering on the void, in search of promised land and a steeple. Sands of time slide down an invisible slope never accruing, leaving nothing but a swirling trail with no meaning. Where about the world turns I no longer know.

I wave goodbye as my mind steadily floats ahead of me, forever to desert thee. I embrace my new friends perched upon my shoulders, rocks for which I cannot explain convey emotion but sit motionless and do not complain. With little grief for the world behind me I continue sail to what is beyond.

Now darkness begins to pool around and in the stale air I begin to suffocate. Stellar make up no longer present. Eyes and ears tell no story. The mind has departed and now my 2 silent friends and darkness transfer only emotion, forever my only devotion.

Edit: I posted this as kinda a self archive but apparently a few folks like it so, thanks guys. Anyway, it is just now, a few days later I realise that this was an imagery of life cycle that I had floating in my head. It's kinda weird and made no sense to me before but now I understand myself.
