Intentionally left he main story paragraph missing. Might add it later.



This huge headache made him feel even worse than he usually did, while in a desperate need of his dose, this asshole was late again and there was no sign that he d show up anytime soon. The cold air and the street full of strangers really did mess with his mind. 


The way he barely got away with the last robbery somehow got through to his conscience and he promised that as soon as he spent the money he d get clean. It wasnt his first time to promise that. He made the same promise to his dying mother years ago, yet he failed to fulfil it. Would this promise have the same destiny?
