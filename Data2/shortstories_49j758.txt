Preface: I was reading a lot of Bukowski a the time.




Whats up? She questioned me.

Oh, you know, the usual, I said without looking.

I felt a cold presence in her stare.

Feeling happy?

Not yet, get over here.

Noyou let go.

Over the past fifteen years she gained a whole lot of weight. I was more attracted to her sister. I decided to call her sister that night. When we first met she was seeing this guy name Phil. I think they got married. Her name was Angela.

Angela, I said into the phone.

Uh, who is this?

Its Joe. She was trying me.

Oh, how are you?

Good. Listen, I need a good nut.

Dont we all?

Does Phil give it to your hard? Does he fuck you good?

Not like he used to. Hows your marriage?

Your sister has seen better times.

So is that what you do? You just move on when you dont feel like it anymore? When its not there?

Life is a constant game of recycling.

Recycled condoms and used-up memories, she said.

My brain has enough of those.

She sighed heavily into the phone.

Can I come over at 8? I asked.

Ok well I just have to do the dishes first.

Ok, Ill come at 8. See you later. I hung up.

My wife was standing in the kitchen staring at the empty jar of jelly.

Did you ever wonder how much power goes into making a glass jar? She asked.

I never thought about it. I said. I went to the fridge and grabbed the carton of orange juice. I finished it, drinking from the spout. Ill be back later, I need to get a few things from the store.

She walked into the bathroom and locked the door.

Angela was waiting at 7:55pm. I was there five minutes early. She was wearing a nightgown. The sidewalk in front of her building had no crab grass growing out of it. The door-knob was tarnished. I saw her standing in the window looking down but I knocked anyway.

She opened the door.

Hello Angela.

Hey Joe.

I leaned in to kiss her. She wrapped her arms around me. I did her right there on the floor. We moved to the couch when she complained of back pain.

She lit a cigarette. She lit mine for me.

There was a painting on the wall.

I dont get that painting on the wall. What is that supposed to be? I asked.

Its Schubert, she said, its about a girl who lost her shoes.

Lost her shoes thats a hell of a thing to paint about, I replied honestly.

Well, you should get going. Phil will be home soon.

You were a great fuck, you know that? I told her.

I know.

Well, Ill call you soon.

Yes, Joe.

I walked back home. It was a short walk. When I got home my wife was asleep. I watched TV on the couch until I passed out.
