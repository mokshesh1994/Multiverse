I tell my dad to go on the porch and grab my shoes. Im too nervous to go out there and get them myself. I can feel it moving around out there, whatever it is. And I can somehow tell its after me, not him. Like I somehow know Im the only real one in the dream, and it only wants me. I have that uneasy feeling you get from dreaming that keeps building on top of itself, and I know I need to move quickly before it gets worse. So he goes and gets the shoes, and I put them on. Except the dream skips this part. Im staring at him like, Dad, what are you doing? I need my shoes. I just want to leave so badly. The feeling is getting worse already, turning from a sense of uneasiness to a sense of fear of whatever it is thats out there. So Im like, Fuck it, I need to get out of here. For whatever reason I know that as long as I have my shoes Im free to leave, but I cant go anywhere without them. I can stay here and it can come get me, or I can risk it and get out. So I cross the doorway from my kitchen on to my porch and turn to look to see where I remember leaving them, and they arent there. At this point the feeling is at its crest. Im at the part in the dream where the dream reaches its limit, and Im ready to either fall or wake up. Im totally afraid now, probably muttering or stirring in my bed somewhere. I look down and in one swift motion realize my shoes are on my feet. In one quick moment I realize whats happening. How Im being tricked by my own dream because it knows exactly what I need to escape it. I look up and for the smallest fraction of a thought of a second I see this hunched over black entity baring at me. Then my eyes are thrust open and Im awake in my bed brimming with fear.
