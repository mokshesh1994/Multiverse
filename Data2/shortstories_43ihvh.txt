The only time I can acknowledge winning the battle of falling asleep is when I lose the war by waking up. 

There's this one fucking asshole who I see every night. From what I can tell, he only exists at night. His only purpose seems to be to mock me without even acknowledging me. He probably doesn't even know my name. I can see him rolling his eyes at me just by hearing him talk. It doesn't help that he practically has a pack of hyenas laughing at each quip. While they clap and screech, he stands there with one eyebrow raised, half-smiling. The other half can't be bothered. This routine has been going on for at least six months, and I couldn't tell you a single thing he has said. I'm usually too busy reminding myself not to drool while questioning whether or not I took enough melatonin. I'm still not convinced that it actually does anything other than remind me to go visit my grandma; her shaky hands make it hard for her to notice the lighter ambien bottle after my visits. 

Some people like to finish their days off by looking back at what they have accomplished. If I did that, I think a black hole would open up in my living room. My days consist of a series of small battles that end when the next one begins. I already mentioned the great Battle Of Sleep. But there's others too, such as The Battle Of Hunger But No Appetite. That one gets pretty intense, but I've yet to actually win. Eventually some mush that might as well be paper finds its way into my mouth. 

I actually have a good feeling about tonight though. Sure, I'll still sit there and listen to that smug asshole babble on during his monologue. I'll even have some food. But tonight, I'm going to win. I'm going to win big. All the credit goes to my grandma's doctor for the new gift he prescribed her. I got through those suckers quick. 

Tonight I'm going to win the war.
