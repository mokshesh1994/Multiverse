I approached the door with a purpose I was wholly unaware of, and as I opened it began to speak without any conscious engagement.

"Rex!" I called out into the night.

This was not my house. I was uncertain whose it truly belonged to or if it even existed, perhaps being a product of my imagination.

"Rex!" I called out again.

In front of me lay a field of darkness, spreading infinitely across my minds void. I was aware of Rex, my dog I received as a child, traversing the fields. Even through the darkness I could see him coming towards me, yet I still called out.

"Rex!"

My conscious was separated from my body, leaving me unaware of my current state of mind. As I listened to my calls I could hear a tone of fear hiding itself within. Then, another call.

"Rex."

But this call was different. It was not my voice, and it instead protruded from the fields of darkness I lay my eyes upon.

"Rex." It called out again.

In the distance, beyond my pet, my eyes could make out the silhouette of a man approaching the house. I now shared the feeling of dread which was present within my detached body.

"Rex!" I called out.

"Rex." The voice repeated my words.

The two grew closer to the house, however it appeared as though the man was moving faster than my dog. I attempted to judge who would reach first but my mind began to fill with panic. 

"Rex!" I called.

"Rex." The voice grew louder.

I feared the intentions of this man as he grew ever so close to me.

"Rex!" My voice filled with panic.

"Rex." It repeated.

He was now only a few feet within my dog, but I would not look to his face.

"Rex!" I screamed.

"Rex." It repeated once more.

My heart filled with anxious fury as he was now within reach of my door.

"Rex." He uttered with a sinister volume.

As my dog entered the home I slammed the door shut with relief. But as it closed its final inches the man shoved his foot in the door.
