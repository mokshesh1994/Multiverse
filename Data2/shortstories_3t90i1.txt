Prologue

December 25th, 1957 - 7:00 AM. The bombs dropped. This was an event worth seeing no matter the radiation it caused you. Vast mushroom shaped clouds arose into the sky, in beautiful maroon and bright yellow hues. The smell of burnt remains drifted through the air, being cooked in excruciating heat. This was the beginning of the outgrowth, and the end of enlightenment.

Story

It was a cold morning, as bitter and bleak as the authors heart. It was as dark and stormy as death itself, and nothing could re-light the morale Paul Douglas once had. The blaze of fire between Paul and Christopher Walter, would never be strong enough to pierce the grim vacancy of solid ebony darkness. The death of Harold Stevenson, their third wheel to survival, had made the gloom, gloomier and the icy cold icier. The outgrowth was the only thing that could live in this environment. After many hours of debate to keep up the spirit, they had decided that this time would be known as a nuclear christmas; now though, Christopher had been having second thoughts. One could not live in a desolate wasteland on his own without some phenomenon to captivate their mind. According to Christopher, Pauls ponderous style of speaking made argueing over survival a chore. For these men, it only made sense to cross a bridge that had already burnt down and to hold tools that couldn't break and couldnt build. Life became a box of radioactive waste, and radioactive waste became life. Wild beasts were born of the contaminated water and the tainted air. They knew it was the worst way out; it was the simplest though.
