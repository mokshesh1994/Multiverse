"Welcome to the neighbourhood," the grey haired man said. "This is a family recipe, try it with a nice red," his wife added.

After the standard exchange of get-to-know-yous the neighbours left, and the home owner and his wife went back to unpacking.

Later that night, after the knick knacks had been unpacked, and the furniture had been re arranged four times, they decided on dinner. The meat loaf the neighbours brought looked good enough, so they heated it up.

They both loved comfort food, and the home owner specifically loved this meat loaf. He thought to himself, 'I'm going to love it here; I've never met another cannibal before.'
