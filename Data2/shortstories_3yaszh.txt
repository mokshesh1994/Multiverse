To BW:  Wondrous, Adventurous, Complicated

Chapter 4: Simple

Little things can make all the difference in the world from a hello to a Happy Holidays can change how a person feels. When a person decides to not acknowledge something like that it can really hurt a person. Working retail has shown me that even if you get the holiday wrong and wish someone a Merry Christmas who doesn't celebrate Christmas they will at least acknowledge that you said it and say something similar back. This wasn't the case yesterday I received three Merry Christmas from people I knew would say it back yet I had said it to four people. I decided against sending a present due to the nature of the situation and I have items to send that I will likely return over the next few days. Yes, it would have been expensive to ship but I was willing to do it because I do care deeply. Growing up I was always told to do certain things to make a person feel special from wishing them a good day to bringing them flowers. In the end of the day those things do matter to a person no matter how many or how little times it does happen. Remembering someone's favorite book or song on a day they need help protecting themselves from the outside world can make all the difference in that moment. To others what you do can make all the difference.

Thanks for reading And as always IBW! Hope you guys had an amazing holidays!
