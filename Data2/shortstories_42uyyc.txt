Unit A43-D swept a small piece of debris off the floor into a dustpan, and dumped it into an overflowing trash bin. The kitchen, like the rest of the house, and Unit A43-D was decaying. Slowly eroding away as time passed away. The sealing was cracked. The walls had dark green mildew. By Unit A43s internal clock it could tell that 20 years, 3 months, 17 days, 4 hours, and 32 seconds had passed since it had last seen a human. 33, 34,35 

Over 20 years have passed since the small human female offspring who referred to Unit A43-D as Andy had last been seen. Over 20 years since the older human male who purchased and activated Unit A43-D had given it a command. Unit A43-D did not miss them because an Intelligent Service Automaton, ISA for short, such as Unit A43-D was incapable of feeling such complex emotions. ISAs were aware enough to wonder. Wonder if it would ever see anyone ever again. Wonder if anyone or anything would ever come around to perform the maintenance that Unit A43-D needed. Wonder if it would ever fulfill its purpose again.

Unit A43-Ds battery was running low. Just 2% left. It was design to hold a charge for over a month, but the charging station had broken down 28 days earlier just like most of the appliances in the house. Unit A43-D sensed that its battery would run out in less than one minute. It would shut down, and most likely it would not be turned on or repaired again. 

Unit A43-D approached the nearest kitchen window. It wiped a small area of dust off, and looked out at the ruined decay of what use to be a beautiful Metropolis. A symbol of human ingenuity and talent, just like ISAs. Now all that remained was dust, the charcoal black carcass of destroyed vehicles, and rubble remains of beautiful architecture. All underneath a burning dark amber sky. 

1% power left. Shut down sequence initiated. As Unit A43-Ds conciseness faded it had one final though, will I ever work again?
