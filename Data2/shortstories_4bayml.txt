He drives onward. The blazing sun strikes my cheek, and its warmth reminds me that its summer. Finally, the months of my surgical rotation have come to an end. Here I am with my favorite people. 

My close friend dawdles in the back seat. I cant really tell what shes doing, but she is one to dawdle.

 I turn to see him next to me. He is looking straight ahead, rocking his head to the melody playing in the background. I didnt expect to be so happy today. This bliss is just right. I wish it would last. 

Nick, thats his name, looks as good as ever. I never knew that I would feel this way towards him. Im not good with these sorts of things. Emotions are exhausting, sometimes overwhelming. He is my exception. 

Its hard to describe how easily our friendship developed. The charisma and charm that empowers every word that comes out of his mouth captured me.  He is more than meets the eye, and Ive seen it. 

Now we would swim and drink.

As we arrived to his family home, we made ourselves comfortable. 

Mi casa es tu casa! he yelled as he welcomed us inside. His large brown lab greeted us at the door. He loves his old lab. 

We made a few drinks. My friend, the one who dawdles, stayed indoors. She was stuck in a rut and kept texting a lover. I let her be and followed Nick into the abyss  abyss of our lust, abyss of our love, abyss of his pool. 

As I waded through, the ripples connected us. I swam around him freely. I thought of my future while he talked about the days to come. 

Would Nick be in it? Was this true? 

It was complicated. 

We were complicated. 

He went back and forth  girls, boys? He liked them both alike it seemed. I was his first boy. 

Most of all though, he liked his girlfriend. 
So I knew the answer to my question, but I played. Who doesnt like a game?
