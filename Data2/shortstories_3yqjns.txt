   it was raining on a cold night and she, a small girl of 3 years old who was holding her mother's hand were going to their home when under a street light she came across a blue colored stone which is about to be run over by a bulldozer so this little girl who is yet to experience the world , who doesn't know the difference between courage and fear escapes herself from the mother's grip and dashes toward the stone which was glowing a few feet beside her and as she bends forward and touches it there's a sudden blue light explosion which seems to shoot into the space ,almost blinds the passengers by and this makes the bulldozer rider come to a halt and her mother who is shaking from the sudden flurry of incidents which happened in an instant runs towards her daughter and hugs her holding back tears all the while even angry at her scolding her little daughter .

  Back in the house after dinner the little girl runs up to her room and opens her hand which she has been holding it all night. this little girl now exuding a glow in her face which reflected the blue stone .she has no idea why she even wanted to save this stone when she has seen many marbles around the road ,many gems which she didn't care about but this uni colored stone beautiful yet simple she wanted to save it and she did .she promised to herself that she would never leave that stone and would always keep it with her .....and she did ....she grew up with it ..she always had a pouch for it and for a few weeks there was always a buzzing sound around her which she didn't notice but one particular day she came home because she was very sick and was bed ridden for a week and during this period the buzzing sound seemed to increase and the glow of the blue stone also flickered with a certain focused velocity .her parents were flabbergasted as to find out where this sound was coming from and searched the whole room but unlucky to find the culprit which they decided to be the insects ,one night the little girl having a confused curiosity pulled the stone closer to her ear and stayed silent and that's when she heard it ..the stone was talking to her ..it was saying her to "get well soon" and she acknowledged it by replying "thanks" which made the buzzing sound disappear .she could not contain her excitement most of us would've been scared or even destroyed the stone because of unnatural fears but this girl who is pure of heart didn't know those feelings she just thought of the stone as her friend and kept talking to it. she even told it her mother who was scared at first but got equally excited later all she wanted was for her little daughter to be happy and she was .

  The girl started growing into a fine woman , now 15 and about to go to high school, she always would talk to the stone as she made new friends too but no one knew this secret about her but as she was maturing she also wanted to know the origins of this blue stone and how they exist and from where did they occur so she used to read all sorts of books ,from myths to history to fiction ...nowhere did she find the birth of this mystery stone but one day traveling to her hometown there was a book sale of unused and old books to which she jumped happily and shouted her father to stop the vehicle and thus she went into it not expecting anything but as she was going through the books there was one book which caught her eye which was pretty old and worn out but still pages intact , it said "The legend of the talking stones" she bought it and as instantly she went into the vehicle she started reading it and started making notes and few of them were

There are different colored stones which are spread across the earth Each Stone chooses it's Master and to only them it can glow and communicate but invisible to others   
They glow and flicker based on the master's feelings
    The history of them is unknown but they have few names to which they seemed to respond
    Blue : Sapphire, Green : Emerald, Blue : Ruby, Yellow, Topaz etc

and that's where it ends and she wanted to know more but happy with the new information she got



excited to try it out she waited until she got into the room and then she put the stone on the bed just few inches away from her (by now the buzzing of the stone was deafening) she slowly shouts "Sapphire " and

 and the stone shoots light and responds "Yes Princess" and the girl's heart almost beating hard with excitement she responds quickly "Which princess? i'm not a princess. i'm just a girl .....who are you Sapphire ? where did you come from ? and why are you blue? " . Then the stone emitted deafening sound and almost exploded with blue light ,the moment the girl closed her eyes she was taken into the space with millions of glittering stars and

Among the stars far far away there flickers a faint light emitted by a small star called as Cynos which most of the life roaming the space haven't heard of and hidden from everyone . It had a few million living beings in it, but this star was filled with colorful leaves and different colored oceans and stones ... but this star had a cruel king which ruled the star with violence .but there was a women who was able to communicate with this star ,she could identify the auras and the colors people emitted and she knew the source of this planet's life was through it's life stones on this planet which the king wanted to use them to increase his power to satisfy his greed so she collected all of those stones by traveling the whole star .it still needed to go to another planet which has life and needed the source and energy to pass through the space so before the king caught onto her she fought alone as he was destroying the environments and also was about to destroy the planet with his greed she made her heart into a stone ,which was bright blue (into the bag) and left it into the space a land which has life like it's own and found earth and the stones were scattered around the earth by the impact .the Cynos Lady's work was done she protected her planet's life ,she was happy to sacrifice her life for the good of the planet ,also so that the star's life can live on in another place and that's how the legend of "The Stone Princess" was created .

The girl was now crying as she saw the death of a star and it's people but was also happy that the star was still alive on this planet in some way .that's when the stone spoke in a soft yet commanding voice "Thank You for saving the heart of our planet and the courage you showed that day automatically made you our princess ,so you may just be a little girl but to Cynos you are our Princess,Our Stone Princess" and the glow of the light again went faint as before and stopped buzzing.From then on ,the girl, The stone princess used to collect the stones of all types ..it didn't matter which color because she could now sense what stones she could hear and based on that she chose the stones and started collecting and traveled the world collecting stones .


---
Now About to go to college turning 19 she must have thousands of stones which she gave a home and cared for ...no one understood it ...no one knew it ...no one would get it even if she said ....so whenever someone asks why she collects stones ..she just replies "Because I like them " and that seemed to satisfy most of them ... she had almost all of them ..all of the colored stones except one color and she thought she'll find it too someday but didn't really care about it much .however friends she may have had her heart also in a way represented the stone reflecting her hardships she has gone through and all the confidence she may have lost .her heart turned unbreakable with walls so strong ..no one was allowed into ...even though she may smile on the outside she wasn't really happy ..but she was always helping in nature and always caring about others ..along the way she forgot to help and care about herself too .She only had her loving family and her stones to really keep her happy ,other than that nothing until one day she met a guy in her class during college who she was pulled towards and this surprised her because the guy was not attractive and smart too but she was pulled to him nonetheless ,she slowly starts noticing that the same guy is also noticing her and even he looks as surprised as her as to why he is pulled towards her but he looks more sure that he likes her ....slowly the girl starts talking to him and starts noticing that they don't even have the same interests in a lot of things but she still enjoys his company .she still is more comfortable around him than any of her friends .


---
One day while walking with him she takes up a stone and puts it in her bag and he asks "why?" and she replies as she does to everyone that because she likes it so he interjects with another question like "do you always keep collecting them?" and she replies "yes" with a slightly raised eyebrow and he gladly chuckles which confuses her even more but she leaves it at that ...They both talk for a year knowing every thing about each of them and have grown even more close ...so close that the guy wanted to be together with her forever so one day he tells the girl that he has s surprise for her and then he takes out a Stone....it was a Bright Red Ruby Stone

and gently looks at her and says " i've had this stone for many years and i've found it in a park ..it was glowing brightly and i was surprised no one saw it and took it up and it was with me ever since ,  i've done research and i know you did too so you know what this means but i never collected the stones i wasn't much interested in them until i met you ...i don't know why after meeting you the only thing i want to do was collect more stones ..not for me ....but for you ....hope you'll accept my love in the form of these stones " and looks up at her ,by now the girl is crying (tears of happiness) and she replies "i accepted your love before i even met you" and takes out her Bright Blue Sapphire Stone ...and shows it to him and there were no words needed after that they both knew what was going to happen next even though they never experienced it and never came across this strong feeling they just went along with the flow of those emotions and just put those two stones together , a light shot out of those two stones and entwined into the sky and danced alongside with the birds ,where a new Stone was created in that moment by the love of these two souls .a Princess from one place and another Prince from another Place ...a Bright glow ..A brighter glow than these two stones combined was being exuded from this Stone it was "Bright Violet Stone "
