This is going to be a multiple part short story, this is also my first time on this sub so please critique and give feedback :) 

A man once said "Power is no blessing in itself, except when it is used to protect the innocent." These words bellow through my head often. I have a great story to tell, but let's start from the beginning. 

     Life began for me in the small town of Durango Colorado, I was never just the average kid. Throughout school I excelled at all my classes and did great in sports, especially football. My senior year of high school I had the perfect future planned, a sport scholarship to the University of Alabama which would hopefully lead to a future in the NFL. When I landed this I was like a celebrity in my town, everyone wanted to be my friend and the girls were all over me. But then everything came crashing down. 

     The headline read "Football star gets charged with MIP and reckless driving." This felt like the end of the world, my scholarship got pulled and next thing I knew I was a nobody. Depression approached like a freight train and suicide felt like a real option. That is until I saw him sitting at the booth in the cafeteria, it was a US Navy recruiter, and since I had nothing to do during lunch I decided to talk to him. As I approached his eyes lit up and I could tell he recognized me.

      "Hey you're that kid from the newspaper, life sucks I know but have you thought about a future in the military?" My instant reaction was to walk away but I answered anyways "Not really, I always had a plan, but not anymore."  He grinned and said "well you seem like a smart kid and I know you have the physical ability we need." It was at this point that he produced a pamphlet for the SEALS. My heart raced a little and I thought to myself "does this guy really think I have what it takes?" My mind started to race at the possibilities, I grabbed the pamphlet and briskly walked away; He chuckled.
