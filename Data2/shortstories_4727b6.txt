It began in a rather special way. Even though our surroundings and our situation were both quite ordinary. It was the summer you turned sixteen. Sixteen seems like so little now.

We were at a party. Because it was summer and hot, and because no one would or could throw parties at home, we all met outside that summer. Large groups of us gathered down by the water. We talked and joked while smoking cigarettes stolen from the coat pockets of our older siblings. We drank beer from the can and pretended to love the taste, as if it reminded us of sweet, hot summer days. None of us really liked beer back then.

Every once in a while someone would bring a bottle of liquor they had stolen from their parents. We forced that down too. We pretended to be drunk. And the few kids who really did get drunk, pretended to enjoy it. In reality it sort of scared most of us.

The night we met was one of those nights. The air was warm and the water sloshed against the rocks. You were wearing a flowery shirt which you had to take off and hang on a tree. You had ridden your bike the five miles from your house to the party, and the shirt was drenched in sweat. You wrapped yourself in a blanket and tried to keep warm with a quarter bottle of brandy. 

We started talking. I dont remember exactly how it happened, but it felt very natural. I knew who you were. You had spent a lot of time hanging out with with one of my friends. She thought you were cute. And you knew who I was. You had seen me sing once. At one of the concerts where you played piano.

You made me laugh. It was effortless. There was a bubble around us. I forgot about how I didnt like how my hair looked, and about how I didnt feel like I could trust any of my friends. You shared your blanket with me once your shirt had dried, and you told me about how you liked philosophy. Music.

You let me drink from the bottle you had brought, and you looked at me with big eyes when I swallowed the brandy without making a face. It is a silly thing to be proud of, but I was fifteen and looking to impress you. You were so funny when you tried it for yourself. I can remember you coughing.

Once we had finished the brandy we turned it into a message in a bottle, and we threw it into the ocean from the rocks. You wrote down a quote you liked and we threw it. I think it was Gandhi. It connected us in a way.

It became dark. As dark as it gets on late summer nights where we live. One of your friends had drunk too much, and you were going to ride home in the car with her. I walked with you through the woods to the car. You had your arm around me. We didnt speak.

I put my number in your phone and we hugged goodbye. You squeezed me tightly before you got into the car and left.

I went back to the party. Back to my friends. And from the rocks where I stood, I could see our message in a bottle bobbing up and down in the water.
