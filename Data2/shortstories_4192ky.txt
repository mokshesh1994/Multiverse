You are insane my sister tells me and starts shaking her head again.

Why? This is the opportunity of a lifetimeI will make history I inform her, without looking up and continue to throw all my belongings into my backpack.

You know how many things can go wrong Adam? Lidia questions and stops pacing the room.

I knowI signed the waver. Besides I will only be going one hour into the future. I tell her for what feels like the thousands time.

You are unbelievable. At least tell Mom and Dad She pleads.

I cant. You know that this is highly classified. I was only allowed to tell one person and you are it! I say and look at her.

You are soldier, not a time Traveller! Lidia exclaims and throws her hands into the air of frustration.

I am also a engineer, in case you forgot I point at the framed piece of paper on my bedroom wall. I graduated with honours from MIT and right after graduation I joined the army. For three years I was stationed all over the world and then joined the Seals.

For three more years Uncle Sam sent me into every forsaken sandbox, before I accepted a stateside job. Never in my wildest dreams I would have imagined to be part of the ITTA, let alone being selected as the first traveller. I have to go Sis. I will see you soon. I hug her, give her a kiss on the forehead, before walking out of the room. With my backpack shouldered I leave my house.

A taxi is already waiting for me, to take me to the airport. Without so much as a backward glance, we drive off.

Sir The Lieutenant on the gate checks my credentials, before handing them back to me with a nod.

I salute him, before Private Jenkins, my driver, drives through the gates. Welcome back to Peterson Air force Base, Sir.

Thank you Private... good to be back. I answer absently, as I continue to stare out of the window.

I get dropped off a few minutes later in front of the entrance to the Chyenne Mountain Nuclear Bunker, where NORAD, is located. Two months from now, I will step into this building for the last time, before I attempt to travel one hour ahead in time. Until that date, I have a lot of preparing to do, as well as finish and test the device.

I walk into the building, past NORAD, FEMA and the Air Weather Service, before I reach a unnamed door. I swipe my access card and enter ITTA.

In the front room, I lock away my phone and other personal effects into the to me designated locker. I swipe my access card again and enter the big, warehouse like room. Sitting in the middle of the room, is the time travelling capsule and all around it are different Workstations set up.

On the right hand side, behind a thick glass window is the control centre and behind all those chairs on the wall is written ITTA in bold letters. Below that its says: International Time Travelling Agency.

"Are you ready Adam? Phil, the German engineer, questions, as I get into my special suit.

As ready as I will ever be I reply and let him zip up the suit on my back. It looks futuristic. Something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The Suit is out of carbon nanofiber. Dark blue, has black patches sewed over the knees and elbows, a pocket on each of my biceps and one on the right side of my chest. The collar comes halfway up my neck and a black belt is secured around my hips, with a flashlight, a small first aid kid and a loop for my black gloves.

I step into my black special ops boots, slide one knife into the insides of each boot and strap a gun to my right leg, before we make our way to the main room. Everybody is there.

There are about 50 scientist and engineers from Germany, America, Canada, Japan, Russia and France; and they are all here to see me time travel for the first time.

"Good luck" Tim, a French scientist, claps my back, on my way to the capsule.

"See you on the other side" another man says, also clapping me on my back.

I nod and wave to the crowd, before getting into the capsule. We were supposed to have another month, but for some reason the timeframe for the mission was brought forward. We didn't have time to try this before. Didnt even send a monkey or a dog first, like they did with the space flights. We went straight to human guinea pig, i.e. me.

The capsule was not designed for comfort or good looks, it's only there to see if we can travel in time. She is basically a metallic ball with one seat, a control panel, a 3 square meter windshield and a 2 square meter big sunroof.

The plan is that I travel one hour into the future, hopefully coming out on the other end in one piece and in the same location. But in case I do not land in the same location, we stored a couple of rations of food, water and ammunition behind the seat.

This is mission control, five minutes to count down. It is now 11.55 am, November 8, 2015. Please complete your checklist Vladimir, Russian scientist, orders and I grab the checklist from the dashboard.

Once I ticked all the items off the list, its only one minute to go. Lieutenant Commander Paler, this is mission control. Setting the countdown clock to 1 minute. Over.

Copy that, Mission Control. Countdown set for one minute, over I reply and set the clock.

Good luck Lieutenant Commander Paler. See you on the other side. Going radio silent, over Vladimir informs me. Everyone outside the capsule has now moved into the designated observation rooms and is anxiously watching the countdown clock.

As the clock hits zero, I start the machine and press the Go button. This is it. For 4 years we have been researching this and now the moment of truth has arrived.

The machine jumps to life and the engine is surprisingly silent inside of the capsule. I press the red button on my joystick, which controls in which direction I go. The capsule lifts of the ground and a bright light flashes in front of me, before I am being pressed into my seat by the g-force and the room disappears.

For a few seconds there is utter darkness and then the room I was just in, appears in front of me again. With a big thud I smash back down on the ground and slide towards the wall in full speed. Just in time I press the button for the deceleration jets and the capsule comes to a grinding halt, centimetres away from the wall.

That was not how I imagined it would be like I mumble to myself and check the big clock on the wall of 1 pm. Seems like it worked. After years of watching Sci Fi movies about time travel, I expected there to be more colourful lights or at least some sort of gateway. Apparently Sci Fi got that one wrong.

Mission control, this is Lieutenant Commander Paler, I have made it I say, pressing the radio button, but all I hear is static. Mission Control, can you hear me? Again, static.

I look out the window, but there is no one in sight. Have I travelled to far in time and they wrote me off? I quickly check the time on my control panel, but it indicates that I set the travelling time correctly.

I unbuckle myself and push the door open. Hello? Anyone there? I shout, but my question echoes back to me, without an answer from anyone.

I jump out the capsule and look around. Everything looks like it did as I left. The dates on one of the computers tells me that it is still 8th November.

After checking every room of the ITTA space, I am none the wiser. Even if it was 1am, there would be at least one or two people either working or guarding this place. But there is no one. Something is off here, but nothing indicates that they left in a hurry.

I grab my personal effects out of my locker at the entrance and check my phone. No messages, no missed calls and the date also shows 8th November 2015, 1pm. Just like the computers.

I let myself out of the door and go to investigate the rest of the bunker. Everything looks normal. No forced entry in any of the rooms, no sign of struggle or intruders. Everybody seems to have...vanished.

Before daring to step outside the bunker, I quickly go back to the capsule, to get the rations of food, water and ammunition. Just then I discover, that during the drop to the ground, the capsule was badly damaged and smoke has started to come from the engine. I grab some fire extinguishers and spray it until I am sure it won't catch fire.

As I finally step outside, I find a car still running in front of the bunker's entrance without a driver in sight. I get into the car and start exploring the base, in hopes that there is someone here, anyone who could help me find out what happened.

XXXXXX Hours later, I sink exhausted and frustrated onto my bed. Not a single human in sight. Could all of them have abandoned the Base within an hour? Surely not and all the gates were shut, the way they should be.

After a horrible night of sleep, I wake at 6.30 the next morning. I shower, shave and have breakfast, before I walk to the bunker to record a message on the computer. Its for the mission log.

This is Lieutenant Commander Adam Paler of the US Navy. I am at the Peterson Air force Base and it is now 0800 hours. Yesterday, I travelled in time 1 hour ahead. Once I arrived I discovered that the base is empty. I repeat there are no humans on this base. Everything looks as I left it and nothing indicates that the Base has been evacuated. Today I will drive to Colorado Springs in hope I find someone who can explain all of this. I press save and walk out of the bunker.

I take the car and into Colorado Springs, hoping someone there can explain all of this to me. However as I get to the city centre there is no one around. Slowly I make my way through every street in Colorado Springs, either by foot or car.

Doors have been left open, cars still running and pets left to fend for themselves. Again there are no humans in sight. Something has gone wrong, very horribly wrong. Could it be because I travelled in time? Have we upset the space-time continuum that much, that it caused everybody to vanish?

My heart starts beating so hard, that I have to sit down on the stairs of one of the abandoned houses. Was Dr. Richards right? He warned us, but none of us listened.

2 months earlier (a couple of days after Adam gets to the base)

You shouldnt take this lightly Dr Paul Richards says in a warning tone.

We are notbut we have to try Paul My commanding officer, Nicolas Jenkins, replies. This is as close as we have ever gotten and I will be damned if we give up now.

Anything can happen, Nicolas Paul retorts and starts pacing the meeting room. We do not know what the repercussions could be. We should test this and research this further.

We have been researching it for 10 years Michael, one of the lead mechanics interjects. I dont know why you are now trying to backtrack. You yourself presented the plan to the UN.

We could upset the space-time continuum in ways we cannot even think of now. Paul answers and stops pacing. This can have massive repercussions.

Paul, listen to me I say and wait until he looks at me. Let go of those doubts. We are only going forward 1 hour

A lot can happen in an hour Paul informs me and adds I am resigning. I cannot be part of this anymore.

PAULyou cant be serious? You are our lead project manager. You came up with this idea Nicolas exclaims and shakes his head. We only have 1 months to go!

To be honest, I didnt think we are actually going to make it. Maybe part of me hoped that the UN would decline my requestbut thinking about the aftermaththe effects of this....and now that we need to pushed the launch date forward...I cant do it, I am sorry Paul says and walks out of the room.

Dr. Richards quit that day and we never heard of him again.

I stand, get into my car and drive back to the base. As I get back, I find the monitoring and radio room. It is time to see if only the Base and Colorado Springs were affected.

Three Years later

Home sweet home I mutter, as I spot the sign for the Cheyenne Mountain Nuclear Bunker. Three years I have been on the road trying to find another human being. I not only stayed in America, but also travelled to Canada, Mexico, took a boat to Cuba, Cayman Island and Jamaica, before going to Guatemala, Panama and then further through South America. I saw some amazing things, but unfortunately I did not find any humans.

Everybody is gone!

The trip was great, but at times a little lonely. I have seen many different animals and cheated death a couple of times. The first time was in Mexico. The break of the car I was driving at the time failed, as I was going down a steep hill. The car came to a hold just a couple of meters away from a cliff.

The second time I had to run away from a charging gorilla in Brazil. Since no humans are around, not only has Mother Nature started to take back the cities, highways and villages, but also Animals have slowly migrated closer to the cities.

Anyways this Gorilla must have gotten either lost or escaped somewhere, because as I rounded a corner in the city centre of Rio, this massive black Gorilla just stood in front of me. A few seconds passed in which we stared at each other, before he let out a big grunt and I turned and ran for my life. Happy Days!

My usual buzz cut has grown out during the trip and I now look like Tom Hanks in Castaway, however I have stopped at growing a beard. Mine just grows patchy and even though there is no one else but me in this world, I still care a little how I look.

Now I am back here and I will try to assemble the time machine to travel back in time. However it depends how badly the capsule was damaged.

Two Months later

What do you think? I ask Max, my not so small Husky puppy, as I roll out from under the capsule. I found him on the base, as I got back. He must have been abandoned by his mother. Will it work this time? Max just looks at me and then continues to chew the bone I got him from the supermarket.

Here goes to nothing I tell him, pull him up and into the capsule. I have been at this for two months now, without much success. I just cant seem to repair this stupid thing.

I shut the door, strap me and Max in, before starting the start up procedure. There was no way I would leave him behind, so I put a seat in the back, where the rations used to be.

Here we go, Max I press the  Go button and hold my breath.

The engine rattles to life and as it lifts off the ground I shout out a premature YES, before the capsules engine turns back off and I drop to the ground with a loud bang.

SHIT...SHIT...SHIT I shout and smash my hand against the panel so hard that my knuckles start bleeding. Max just looks at me with a worried expression and I sigh. I am sorry Bud...I didnt mean to shout...I just really need this to work.

XXXXXX

You know Max, we really could use some female influence...it smells like a football teams locker room in here I tell him as I clean his poop away. Max just looks at me guilty and I shake my head.

I gave my whole life to the army. There were a couple of women I loved, but there was always a new mission, a new adventure, so they eventually moved on. They didnt want to wait for me, to either quit or die in some god forsaken country.

But I do not regret it. I have done good and I got to travel in time.

I throw the poop into the bin and sit back down on the couch, to continue watching The last man on earth. Ironic I know, but so far this show is quite good.

As I first got back here, I got myself a more comfortable and bigger bed from one of the Houses in the city and put it into the room where the Air Weather Service used to be. Slowly I cleared that space out and accumulated couches, a TV, projectors and so on. The room looks more like a house than a working space now.

Goodbye Buddy I say, take a sip from the bottle of Vodka and start shovelling the dirt back into the grave. Max died yesterday. A snake bit him two days ago and I couldnt save him. In the end he just fell asleep and didnt wake up again.

I slide to the ground beside the half filled hole and rest my back against the Tatarian maple tree, next to my automated rifle. Max was there for me when I wanted to give up and became my best friend. Despite the fact that he couldnt talk back, I always sort of knew what he was thinking.

Its been a year of me constantly trying to fix the capsule, trying to get back to the time where humans were around. But I cannot fix it. I cannot find the root of the problem and it is driving me insane.

I have watched every video on our database, read every log entry and manual, but nothing is helping. Even taking the capsule apart and putting it back together did not help me in identifying the problem.

I take another healthy swig from the bottle and look around. The sun is just setting and I need to get inside soon. Wolves are nightly visitors here now, which makes it unsafe.

One night I spend the entire night out in a car watching them move around and chase the odd deer that dared to come closer.

Everything looks a lot greener now too. Grass and moss has grown over the concrete and trees and bushes have grown thicker. The world is definitely more beautiful than it used to be.

As I cant see the sun anymore, I get up and zick zack my way back to the bunker. I have to get back to work.

AHHHHHHH I sit up straight in my bed. Did I just hear someone scream or did I dream this?

Arggggg.No...no Someone shouts and then I hear laughter. No, it cant be? Or can it?

I jump out of bed, pull on my pants, shoes and grab my automated rifle, as well as my pistol, before I make my way quietly out into the hall.

Ahahhaha...stop tickling me a female voice cries and giggles.

No...not until you tell where it is a male laughs and I can hear more screams and giggles.

As I round the corner I see a girl and a boy running into the ITTA room. HEY.HEY...stop right there I shout, but they dont hear me, and I quickly run after them.

You cant be in here I tell them, but they ignore me or maybe they cant hear me over their laughter. Come on Adam...give up...I wont tell you where I hit the candy the girl says, as she evades the boys hands. I wont give up Lidia the boy laughs and starts another tickling attack.

I walk closer and as the boy turns around I stare into the face of my younger self. How? I question out loud and as I move to touch him, they disappear, leaving me standing there disappointed with my rifle in hand.

What are you looking at me like this for, Sis? I ask and look at her. She looks disappointed.

Why did you do this? She questions and I throw the wrench on the ground in anger.

Because I wanted to do this.because I wanted to travel in time...GOD YOU STILL DONT GET IT! I shout at her. This was always something I was good at

But look at you now...alone in the world and no way of fixing this thing. Was it worth it? My sister questions.

You are not real...you are not real I repeat and close my eyes. Just leave me alone!

XXXXXX Another week later

This has to be fixable I shake my head and kick the capsule out of frustration.

I told you, you wouldnt be able to fix it Lidia informs me with a smug expression on her face. The calculations must be wrong I mutter and walk over to the computer.

You have gone over them a zillion times My sister points out in a bored tone. Give up. You cant fix this.

SHUT UP I shout and look up, but there is no one here. Once again I have been talking to myself. I think I am going insane.

Lieutenant Commander...how did you ever get that title? You cant even fix the time capsule My sister questions from her usual spot on the couch.

Lidia I growl.

I am serious...you worked here for what...two years? You should know everything about this thing she retorts.

Having you complain and moan isnt helping. I point out.

Well you shouldnt have brought me along she says. Face it, I am just telling you, what you cant admit to yourself.

I am an engineer, I am a Navy Seal...there isnt anything I cant do...and I will fix this. I inform her.

XXXXXX

I place the Whisky bottle next to the screen and with a deep breath, I press the button to record my next message.

This is Lieutenant Commander Adam Paler. Till this day there has been no other contact with other humans. I have tried over and over and over again, but the capsule does not seem fixable. It was too badly damaged in the landing.

I can just repeat myself...If someone ever listens to this, do not attempt to time travel. It does not work. Richards was right, we have upset the time-space continuum too much and I paid the price. I do not know where everybody vanished to. I am at the end of my wisdom

Well...that is your own fault Lidia says in the background.

Shut up, I am trying to record a message hereand it is not my fault. I tell her and turn back to the screen. Yes it is...you are giving up too easily She tells me.

Giving up too easily? I have been at this for more than a year...I have taken it apart... put it back together...even replaced every single part of the damn capsule...and guess what? IT. STILL. DOES. NOT. WORK! I stare at her angrily. Now be quite.

As said I have not found a way to repair it and I may never will. I click to save the video, open the bottle of whiskey and take a healthy swig.

On my way out of the bunker, I turn everything off, lock all the doors, before making my way to Maxs Grave.

Hey Buddy, its me again I greet Max, as I sit down against the Tatarian maple tree and take another healthy swig from the bottle. I found this Whisky in one of the offices on the Base. Its, according to the label, 60 years old. People always said that this stuff tastes better when aged, but to be honest, this one just tastes like any other cheap whiskey.

I close my eyes for a second and relish the sun on my face. I am so tired. For the past year I have barely slept and only ate or drunk when I really had the urge to.

I take my gun out of my holster and weigh it in my hand. To this day I am hoping that I am stuck in a bad dream and that I wake up at any moment. If I shoot myself, will I wake up? You know like a kick, as they show it in Inception.

That is a cowards way out My sister points out to me and sits next to me on the ground.

Go away...I am trying to have a moment with Max I tell her, but she stays.

You are talking to a grave...he wont respond Lidia advises.

What like you? You are not real...you are an imagination I take another swig out of the bottle and wince at the burning feeling which hits my throat.

I am real She pouts.

No...I just wish you were.... I tell her.

You will be fine...dont give up. She says, pats my hand and stands. I drown half of the bottle and as I look up Lidia is gone.

I look at the gun in my hand, drown the rest of whisky and put the gun to my head. Lets hope this works I mutter, before I pull the trigger.
