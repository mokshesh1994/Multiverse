""and this surgery award goes to Jaclyn..."

Before his sentence was over, a surge of warmth overcame me.  Everything around me became muddled, as if someone had suddenly unplugged me from the room.

In that moment, I sat alone with my thoughts. I soaked in the honor that now belonged to me.

My racing heart beat as fast as the thoughts that I couldn't process.

Me? It's me? It is me!

I never saw this coming.
I worked diligently these past 2 years, yet I never saw it coming.

I couldn't help but smile. I wish my parents were next to me. They always reassure me. Luckily, my best friend made up the crowd. They just clapped, clapped, clapped...

As the ceremony spotlight came upon me, I knew I had to act.

I crossed the room and walked slowly to the stage, my confidence growing every second with the roaring applause.

Before today, all I could think about was the inevitable end of medical school. 
In a few months, my close friends would disappear into their own lives, leaving 'us' behind. 
For days this idea crushed me.

But today, the people who I loved and who loved me reminded me that it would be okay.

I never saw this coming but it did.

I made it come.

My passion for surgery would guide my way onto a stage again.

I was no longer deaf to the truth.
