Scott Maynard closed the door and sighed. Another day of failures, he thought as he hung up his coat. With only the setting sun to guide him, Scott made his way into the living room and lit a few candles, picked up the days newspaper and sat down on a tatty, half decayed sofa. 

I am glad to report that our fearless leader, Caput Zafar Zain, is on the road to recovery, The newspaper read, and aims to be back in office by the end of the week.

He had hoped the fever would take Zafar Zain, leaving room for somebody with some sense to destroy Cladis and bring the country back to normal. But no, Zafar lives, and Cladis remains active, jamming all electrical equipment around the country. The news did not seem to sadden Scott, it merely provided him with the incentive needed to finish his work on the counter device. 

Five people are awaiting execution after conspiring to murder Caput Zafar in his sleep. Two others have been linked to the group, but they have not yet been captured. Their names are Kent Bentley and Victor Simon. The state is offering a ten-thousand-dollar reward for any information leading to their whereabouts.

After a meal of dried fruit and vegetables, stale bread, and half-spoiled room-temperature milk, Scott lay flat on the sofa and drifted off to sleep. He dreamt that he was standing up on a stage, delivering a speech to a million people. Only, nobody was listening. They were looking at him, they were silent, but they werent paying attention. Except for two people at the front of the stage. They nodded and smiled in agreement with each of his points. The one on the left held a long, blood-stained dagger, while the man beside him sat with his fists tightly clenched. By the end of his speech, the two men stood up and ran off into the crowd. Scott had tried to chase after them, but each member of the audience arose and blocked his path. The two men vanished into the darkness and then his dream ended.
